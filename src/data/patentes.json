BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0002] The ability to incorporate non-genetically encoded amino acids (i.e., \"non-natural amino acids\") into proteins permits the introduction of chemical functional groups that could provide valuable alternatives to the naturally-occurring functional groups, such as the epsilon -NH 2 of lysine, the sulfhydryl -SH of cysteine, the imino group of histidine, etc. Certain chemical functional groups are known to be inert to the functional groups found in the 20 common, genetically-encoded amino acids but react cleanly and efficiently to form stable linkages with functional groups that can be incorporated onto non-natural amino acids. [0003] Methods are now available to selectively introduce chemical functional groups that are not found in proteins, that are chemically inert to all of the functional groups found in the 20 common, genetically encoded amino acids and that may be used to react efficiently and selectively with reagents comprising certain functional groups to form stable covalent linkages. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0004] Disclosed herein are toxic moieties with one or more linker(s), toxic groups linked to non-natural amino acids, and methods for making such non-natural amino acids and polypeptides.

[0023B] Throughout this specification the word \"comprise\", or variations such as 'comprises\" or \"comprising\", will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated element, integer or step, or group of elements, integers or steps, but not the exclusion of any other element, integer or step, or group of elements, integers or steps. [0024] The terms \"aldol-based linkage\" or \"mixed aldol-based linkage\" refers to the acid- or base-catalyzed condensation of one carbonyl compound with the enolate/enol of another carbonyl compound, which may or may not be the same, to generate a hydroxy carbonyl compound- an aldol. [0025] The term \"affinity label,\" as used herein, refers to a label which reversibly or irreversibly binds another molecule, either to modify it, destroy it, or form a compound with it. By way of example, affinity labels include enzymes and their substrates, or antibodies and their antigens. [0026] The terms \"alkoxy,\" \"alkylamino\" and \"alkylthio\" (or thioalkoxy) are used in their conventional sense, and refer to those alkyl groups linked to molecules via an oxygen atom, an amino group, or a sulfur atom, respectively. [0027] The term \"alkyl,\" by itself or as part of another molecule means, unless otherwise stated, a straight or branched chain, or cyclic hydrocarbon radical, or combination thereof, which may be fully saturated, mono- or polyunsaturated and can include di- and multivalent radicals, having the number of carbon atoms designated (i.e. Ci-Cio means one to ten carbons). Examples of saturated hydrocarbon radicals include, but are not limited to, groups such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, t butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, cyclohexyl, (cyclohexyl)methyl, cyclopropylmethyl, homologs and isomers of, for example, n-pentyl, n-hexyl, n-heptyl, n-octyl, and the like. An unsaturated alkyl group is one having one or more double bonds or triple bonds. Examples of unsaturated alkyl groups include, but are not limited to, vinyl, 2 propenyl, crotyl, 2-isopentenyl, 2-(butadienyl), 2,4-pentadienyl, 3-(1,4-pentadienyl), ethynyl, 1- and 3-propynyl, 3-butynyl, and the higher homologs and isomers. 10 The term \"alkyl,\" unless otherwise noted, is also meant to include those derivatives of alkyl defined in more detail herein, such as \"heteroalkyl\", \"haloalkyl\" and \"homoalkyl\". [0028] The term \"alkylene\" by itself or as part of another molecule means a divalent radical derived from an alkane, as exemplified, by (-CH 2 -)n 1 , wherein n may be 1 to about 24. By way of example only, such groups include, but are not limited to, groups having 10 or fewer carbon atoms such as the structures -CH 2\nCH\n2 - and CH 2\nCH\n2\nCH\n2\nCH\n2 -. A \"lower alkyl\" or \"lower alkylene\" is a shorter chain alkyl or alkylene group, generally having eight or fewer carbon atoms. The term \"alkylene,\" unless otherwise noted, is also meant to include those groups described herein as \"heteroalkylene.\" [0029] The term \"amino acid\" refers to naturally occurring and non-natural amino acids, as well as amino acid analogs and amino acid mimetics that function in a manner similar to the naturally occurring amino acids. Naturally encoded amino acids are the 20 common amino acids (alanine, arginine, asparagine, aspartic acid, cysteine, glutamine, glutamic acid, glycine, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, proline, seine, threonine, tryptophan, tyrosine, and valine) and pyrolysine and selenocysteine. Amino acid analogs refers to compounds that have the same basic chemical structure as a 10A WO 2012/166559 PCT/US2012/039468 naturally occurring amino acid, by way of example only, an a-carbon that is bound to a hydrogen, a carboxyl group, an amino group, and an R group. Such analogs may have modified R groups (by way of example, norleucine) or may have modified peptide backbones while still retaining the same basic chemical structure as a naturally occurring amino acid. Non-limiting examples of amino acid analogs include homoserine, norleucine, methionine sulfoxide, methionine methyl sulfonium. [0030] Amino acids may be referred to herein by either their name, their commonly known three letter symbols or by the one-letter symbols recommended by the IUPAC-IUB Biochemical Nomenclature Commission. Additionally, nucleotides, may be referred to by their commonly accepted single-letter codes. [0031] An \"amino terminus modification group\" refers to any molecule that can be attached to a terminal amine group. By way of example, such terminal amine groups may be at the end of polymeric molecules, wherein such polymeric molecules include, but are not limited to, polypeptides, polynucleotides, and polysaccharides. Terminus modification groups include but are not limited to, various water soluble polymers, peptides or proteins. By way of example only, terminus modification groups include polyethylene glycol or serum albumin. Terminus modification groups may be used to modify therapeutic characteristics of the polymeric molecule, including but not limited to increasing the serum half-life of peptides. [0032] By \"antibody fragment\" is meant any form of an antibody other than the full-length form. Antibody fragments herein include antibodies that are smaller components that exist within full-length antibodies, and antibodies that have been engineered. Antibody fragments include but are not limited to Fv, Fc, Fab, and (Fab')2, single chain Fv (scFv), diabodies, triabodies, tetrabodies, bifunctional hybrid antibodies, CDR1, CDR2, CDR3, combinations of CDR's, variable regions, framework regions, constant regions, heavy chains, light chains, and variable regions, and alternative scaffold non-antibody molecules, bispecific antibodies, and the like (Maynard & Georgiou, 2000, Annu. Rev. Biomed. Eng. 2:339-76; Hudson, 1998, Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 9:395-402). Another functional substructure is a single chain Fv (scFv), comprised of the variable regions of the immunoglobulin heavy and light chain, covalently connected by a peptide linker (S-z Hu et al., 1996, Cancer Research, 56, 3055-3061). These small (Mr 25,000) proteins generally retain specificity and affinity for antigen in a single polypeptide and can provide a convenient building block for larger, antigen-specific molecules. Unless specifically noted otherwise, statements and claims that use the term \"antibody\" or \"antibodies\" specifically includes \"antibody fragment\" and \"antibody fragments.\" [0033] By \"antibody-drug conjugate, or \"ADC\", as used herein, refers to an antibody molecule, or fragment thereof, that is covalently bonded to one or more biologically active molecule(s). The biologically active molecule may be conjugated to the antibody through a linker, polymer, or other covalent bond. 11 WO 2012/166559 PCT/US2012/039468 [0034] The term \"aromatic\" or \"aryl\", as used herein, refers to a closed ring structure which has at least one ring having a conjugated pi electron system and includes both carbocyclic aryl and heterocyclic aryl (or \"heteroaryl\" or \"heteroaromatic\") groups. The carbocyclic or heterocyclic aromatic group may contain from 5 to 20 ring atoms. The term includes monocyclic rings linked covalently or fused-ring polycyclic (i.e., rings which share adjacent pairs of carbon atoms) groups. An aromatic group can be unsubstituted or substituted. Non-limiting examples of \"aromatic\" or \"aryl\", groups include phenyl, 1-naphthyl, 2 naphthyl, 4-biphenyl, anthracenyl, and phenanthracenyl. Substituents for each of the above noted aryl and heteroaryl ring systems are selected from the group of acceptable substituents described herein. [0035] For brevity, the term \"aromatic\" or \"aryl\" when used in combination with other terms (including but not limited to, aryloxy, arylthioxy, aralkyl) includes both aryl and heteroaryl rings as defined above. Thus, the term \"aralkyl\" or \"alkaryl\" is meant to include those radicals in which an aryl group is attached to an alkyl group (including but not limited to, benzyl, phenethyl, pyridylmethyl and the like) including those alkyl groups in which a carbon atom (including but not limited to, a methylene group) has been replaced by a heteroatom, by way of example only, by an oxygen atom. Examples of such aryl groups include, but are not limited to, phenoxymethyl, 2-pyridyloxymethyl, 3-(1-naphthyloxy)propyl, and the like. [0036] The term \"arylene\", as used herein, refers to a divalent aryl radical. Non-limiting examples of \"arylene\" include phenylene, pyridinylene, pyrimidinylene and thiophenylene. Substituents for arylene groups are selected from the group of acceptable substituents described herein. [0037] A \"bifunctional polymer\", also referred to as a \"bifunctional linker\", refers to a polymer comprising two functional groups that are capable of reacting specifically with other moieties to form covalent or non-covalent linkages. Such moieties may include, but are not limited to, the side groups on natural or non-natural amino acids or peptides which contain such natural or non-natural amino acids.

[0038] The term \"bioavailability,\" as used herein, refers to the rate and extent to which a substance or its active moiety is delivered from a pharmaceutical dosage form and becomes available at the site of action or in the general circulation. Increases in bioavailability refers to increasing the rate and extent a substance or its active moiety is delivered from a pharmaceutical dosage form and becomes available at the site of action or in the general circulation. By way of example, an increase in bioavailability may be indicated as an increase in concentration of the substance or its active moiety in the blood when compared to other substances or active moieties. A non-limiting example of a method to evaluate increases in bioavailability is given in examples 21-25. This method may be used for evaluating the bioavailability of any polypeptide.

Analysis of modified biological activity can be performed by comparing the biological activity of the non-natural polypeptide to that of the natural polypeptide. [0041] The term \"biomaterial,\" as used herein, refers to a biologically-derived material, including but not limited to material obtained from bioreactors and/or from recombinant methods and techniques.

[0047] The term \"chemically cleavable group,\" also referred to as \"chemically labile\", as used herein, refers to a group which breaks or cleaves upon exposure to acid, base, oxidizing agents, reducing agents, chemical inititiators, or radical initiators. [0048] The term \"chemiluminescent group,\" as used herein, refers to a group which emits light as a result of a chemical reaction without the addition of heat. By way of example only, luminol (5-amino-2,3 dihydro-1,4-phthalazinedione) reacts with oxidants like hydrogen peroxide (H 2 0 2 ) in the presence of a base and a metal catalyst to produce an excited state product (3-aminophthalate, 3-APA).

[0051] \"Cofolding,\" as used herein, refers to refolding processes, reactions, or methods which employ at least two molecules which interact with each other and result in the transformation of unfolded or improperly folded molecules to properly folded molecules. By way of example only, \"cofolding,\" employ at least two polypeptides which interact with each other and result in the transformation of unfolded or improperly folded polypeptides to native, properly folded polypeptides. Such polypeptides may contain natural amino acids and/or at least one non-natural amino acid. [0052] A \"comparison window,\" as used herein, refers a segment of any one of contiguous positions used to compare a sequence to a reference sequence of the same number of contiguous positions after the two sequences are optimally aligned. Such contiguous positions include, but are not limited to a group consisting of from about 20 to about 600 sequential units, including about 50 to about 200 sequential units, and about 100 to about 150 sequential units. By way of example only, such sequences include polypeptides and polypeptides containing non-natural amino acids, with the sequential units include, but are not limited to natural and non-natural amino acids. In addition, by way of example only, such sequences include polynucleotides with nucleotides being the corresponding sequential units. Methods of alignment of sequences for comparison are well-known in the art. Optimal alignment of sequences for comparison can be conducted, including but not limited to, by the local homology algorithm of Smith and Waterman (1970) Adv. Appl. Math. 2:482c, by the homology alignment algorithm of Needleman and Wunsch (1970) J. Mol. Biol. 48:443, by the search for similarity method of Pearson and Lipman (1988) Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. USA 85:2444, by computerized implementations of these algorithms (GAP, BESTFIT, FASTA, and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package, Genetics Computer Group, 575 Science Dr., Madison, WI), or by manual alignment and visual inspection (see, e.g., Ausubel et al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology (1995 supplement)). [0053] By way of example, an algorithm which may be used to determine percent sequence identity and sequence similarity are the BLAST and BLAST 2.0 algorithms, which are described in Altschul et al. (1997) Nuc. Acids Res. 25:3389-3402, and Altschul et al. (1990) J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-410, respectively. Software for performing BLAST analyses is publicly available through the National Center for Biotechnology Information. The BLAST algorithm parameters W, T, and X determine the sensitivity and speed of the alignment. The BLASTN program (for nucleotide sequences) uses as defaults a wordlength (W) of 11, an expectation (E) or 10, M=5, N=-4 and a comparison of both strands. For amino acid sequences, the BLASTP program uses as defaults a wordlength of 3, and expectation (E) of 10, and the BLOSUM62 scoring matrix (see Henikoff and Henikoff (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:10915) alignments (B) of 50, expectation (E) of 10, M=5, N=-4, and a comparison of both strands. The BLAST algorithm is typically performed with the \"low complexity\" filter turned off. 15 WO 2012/166559 PCT/US2012/039468 [0054] The BLAST algorithm also performs a statistical analysis of the similarity between two sequences (see, e.g., Karlin and Altschul (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:5873-5787). One measure of similarity provided by the BLAST algorithm is the smallest sum probability (P(N)), which provides an indication of the probability by which a match between two nucleotide or amino acid sequences would occur by chance. For example, a nucleic acid is considered similar to a reference sequence if the smallest sum probability in a comparison of the test nucleic acid to the reference nucleic acid is less than about 0.2, or less than about 0.01, or less than about 0.001. [0055] The term \"conservatively modified variants\" applies to both natural and non-natural amino acid and natural and non-natural nucleic acid sequences, and combinations thereof. With respect to particular nucleic acid sequences, \"conservatively modified variants\" refers to those natural and non-natural nucleic acids which encode identical or essentially identical natural and non-natural amino acid sequences, or where the natural and non-natural nucleic acid does not encode a natural and non-natural amino acid sequence, to essentially identical sequences. By way of example, because of the degeneracy of the genetic code, a large number of functionally identical nucleic acids encode any given protein. For instance, the codons GCA, GCC, GCG and GCU all encode the amino acid alanine. Thus, at every position where an alanine is specified by a codon, the codon can be altered to any of the corresponding codons described without altering the encoded polypeptide. Such nucleic acid variations are \"silent variations,\" which are one species of conservatively modified variations. Thus by way of example every natural or non-natural nucleic acid sequence herein which encodes a natural or non-natural polypeptide also describes every possible silent variation of the natural or non-natural nucleic acid. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that each codon in a natural or non-natural nucleic acid (except AUG, which is ordinarily the only codon for methionine, and TGG, which is ordinarily the only codon for tryptophan) can be modified to yield a functionally identical molecule. Accordingly, each silent variation of a natural and non-natural nucleic acid which encodes a natural and non-natural polypeptide is implicit in each described sequence. [0056] As to amino acid sequences, individual substitutions, deletions or additions to a nucleic acid, peptide, polypeptide, or protein sequence which alters, adds or deletes a single natural and non-natural amino acid or a small percentage of natural and non-natural amino acids in the encoded sequence is a \"conservatively modified variant\" where the alteration results in the deletion of an amino acid, addition of an amino acid, or substitution of a natural and non-natural amino acid with a chemically similar amino acid. Conservative substitution tables providing functionally similar natural amino acids are well known in the art. Such conservatively modified variants are in addition to and do not exclude polymorphic variants, interspecies homologs, and alleles of the methods and compositions described herein. [0057] Conservative substitution tables providing functionally similar amino acids are known to those of ordinary skill in the art. The following eight groups each contain amino acids that are conservative substitutions for one another: 1) Alanine (A), Glycine (G); 16 WO 2012/166559 PCT/US2012/039468 2) Aspartic acid (D), Glutamic acid (E); 3) Asparagine (N), Glutamine (Q); 4) Arginine (R), Lysine (K); 5) Isoleucine (I), Leucine (L), Methionine (M), Valine (V); 6) Phenylalanine (F), Tyrosine (Y), Tryptophan (W); 7) Serine (S), Threonine (T); and 8) Cysteine (C), Methionine (M) (see, e.g., Creighton, Proteins:Structures and Molecular Properties (W H Freeman & Co.; 2nd edition (December 1993) [0058] The terms \"cycloalkyl\" and \"heterocycloalkyl\", by themselves or in combination with other terms, represent, unless otherwise stated, cyclic versions of \"alkyl\" and \"heteroalkyl\", respectively. Thus, a cycloalkyl or heterocycloalkyl include saturated, partially unsaturated and fully unsaturated ring linkages. Additionally, for heterocycloalkyl, a heteroatom can occupy the position at which the heterocycle is attached to the remainder of the molecule. The heteroatom may include, but is not limited to, oxygen, nitrogen or sulfur. Examples of cycloalkyl include, but are not limited to, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, 1-cyclohexenyl, 3-cyclohexenyl, cycloheptyl, and the like.

Additionally, the term encompasses multicyclic structures, including but not limited to, bicyclic and tricyclic ring structures. Similarly, the term \"heterocycloalkylene\" by itself or as part of another molecule means a divalent radical derived from heterocycloalkyl, and the term \"cycloalkylene\" by itself or as part of another molecule means a divalent radical derived from cycloalkyl. [0059] The term \"cyclodextrin,\" as used herein, refers to cyclic carbohydrates consisting of at least six to eight glucose molecules in a ring formation.

The strength of a denaturing agent or denaturant will be determined both by the properties and the concentration of the particular denaturing agent or denaturant. By way of example, denaturing agents or denaturants include, but are not limited to, chaotropes, detergents, organic, water miscible solvents, phospholipids, or a combination thereof. Non limiting examples of chaotropes include, but are not limited to, urea, guanidine, and sodium thiocyanate. Non-limiting examples of detergents may include, but are not limited to, strong detergents such as sodium 17 WO 2012/166559 PCT/US2012/039468 dodecyl sulfate, or polyoxyethylene ethers (e.g. Tween or Triton detergents), Sarkosyl, mild non-ionic detergents (e.g., digitonin), mild cationic detergents such as N->2,3-(Dioleyoxy)-propyl-N,N,N trimethylammonium, mild ionic detergents (e.g. sodium cholate or sodium deoxycholate) or zwitterionic detergents including, but not limited to, sulfobetaines (Zwittergent), 3-(3 chlolamidopropyl)dimethylammonio- 1-propane sulfate (CHAPS), and 3-(3 chlolamidopropyl)dimethylammonio-2-hydroxy- 1-propane sulfonate (CHAPSO).

[0080] The terms \"heterocyclic-based linkage\" or \"heterocycle linkage\" refers to a moiety formed from the reaction of a dicarbonyl group with a diamine group. The resulting reaction product is a heterocycle, including a heteroaryl group or a heterocycloalkyl group.

For heteroalkylene groups, the same or different heteroatoms can also occupy either or both of the chain termini (including but not limited to, alkyleneoxy, alkylenedioxy, alkyleneamino, alkylenediamino, aminooxyalkylene, and the like). Still further, for alkylene and heteroalkylene linking groups, no orientation of the linking group is implied by the direction in which the formula of the linking group is written.

Such percentages to describe the \"percent identity\" of two or more sequences. The identity of a sequence can exist over a region that is at least about 75-100 sequential units in length, over a region that is about 50 sequential units in length, or, where not specified, across the entire sequence. This definition also refers to the complement of a test sequence. By way of example only, two or more polypeptide sequences are identical when the amino acid residues are the same, while two or more polypeptide sequences are \"substantially identical\" if the amino acid residues are about 60% identical, about 65% identical, about 70% identical, about 75% identical, about 80% identical, about 85% identical, about 90% identical, or about 95% identical over a specified region.

[0085] For sequence comparison, typically one sequence acts as a reference sequence, to which test sequences are compared. When using a sequence comparison algorithm, test and reference sequences are entered into a computer, subsequence coordinates are designated, if necessary, and sequence algorithm program parameters are designated. Default program parameters can be used, or alternative parameters can be designated. The sequence comparison algorithm then calculates the percent sequence identities for the test sequences relative to the reference sequence, based on the program parameters.

By way of example, the modified biologically active molecules include, but are not limited to, natural amino acid, non-natural amino acid, natural amino acid polypeptide or non-natural amino acid polypeptide. By way of example, serum half-life is measured by taking blood samples at various time points after administration of the biologically active molecule or modified biologically active molecule, and determining the concentration of that molecule in each sample. Correlation of the serum concentration with time allows calculation of the serum half-life. By way of example, modulated serum half-life may be an increased in serum half-life, which may enable an improved dosing regimens or avoid toxic effects. Such increases in serum may be at least about two fold, at least about three-fold, at least about five-fold, or at least about ten-fold.

Prodrugs are generally drug precursors that, following administration to a subject and subsequent absorption, are converted to an active, or a more active species via some process, such as conversion by a metabolic pathway. Some prodrugs have a chemical group present on the prodrug that renders it less active and/or confers solubility or some other property to the drug.

Prodrugs are converted into active drug within the body through enzymatic or non-enzymatic reactions. Prodrugs may provide improved physiochemical properties such as better solubility, enhanced delivery characteristics, such as specifically targeting a particular cell, tissue, organ or ligand, and improved therapeutic value of the drug. The benefits of such prodrugs include, but are not limited to, (i) ease of administration compared with the parent drug; (ii) the prodrug may be bioavailable by oral administration whereas the parent is not; and (iii) the prodrug may also have improved solubility in pharmaceutical compositions compared with the parent drug. A pro-drug includes a pharmacologically inactive, or reduced-activity, derivative of an active drug. Prodrugs may be designed to modulate the amount of a drug or biologically active molecule that reaches a desired site of action through the manipulation of the properties of a drug, such as physiochemical, biopharmaceutical, or pharmacokinetic properties. An example, without limitation, of a prodrug would be a non-natural amino acid polypeptide which is administered as an ester (the \"prodrug\") to facilitate transmittal across a cell membrane where water solubility is detrimental to mobility but which then is metabolically hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid, the active entity, once inside the cell where water solubility is beneficial. Prodrugs may be designed as reversible drug derivatives, for use as modifiers to enhance drug transport to site-specific tissues.

In such prophylactic applications, such amounts may depend on the patient's state of health, weight, and the like. It is considered well within the skill of the art for one to determine such prophylactically effective amounts by routine experimentation, including, but not limited to, a dose escalation clinical trial. [00118] The term \"protected,\" as used herein, refers to the presence of a \"protecting group\" or moiety that prevents reaction of the chemically reactive functional group under certain reaction conditions.

By way of example only, refolding transforms disulfide bond containing polypeptides from an improperly folded or unfolded state to a native or properly folded conformation with respect to disulfide bonds. Such disulfide bond containing polypeptides may be natural amino acid polypeptides or non-natural amino acid polypeptides. [00127] The term \"resin,\" as used herein, refers to high molecular weight, insoluble polymer beads. By way of example only, such beads may be used as supports for solid phase peptide synthesis, or sites for attachment of molecules prior to purification.

[00129] The term \"safety\" or \"safety profile,\" as used herein, refers to side effects that might be related to administration of a drug relative to the number of times the drug has been administered. By way of example, a drug which has been administered many times and produced only mild or no side effects is said to have an excellent safety profile. A non-limiting example of a method to evaluate the safety profile is given in example 26. This method may be used for evaluating the safety profile of any polypeptide. [00130] The phrase \"selectively hybridizes to\" or \"specifically hybridizes to,\" as used herein, refers to the binding, duplexing, or hybridizing of a molecule to a particular nucleotide sequence under stringent hybridization conditions when that sequence is present in a complex mixture including but not limited to, total cellular or library DNA or RNA.

Such spin-label molecules include, but are not limited to, nitryl radicals and nitroxides, and may be single spin-labels or double spin labels. 31 WO 2012/166559 PCT/US2012/039468 [00132]The term \"stoichiometric,\" as used herein, refers to the ratio of the moles of compounds participating in a chemical reaction being about 0.9 to about 1.1. [00133] The term \"stoichiometric-like,\" as used herein, refers to a chemical reaction which becomes stoichiometric or near-stoichiometric upon changes in reaction conditions or in the presence of additives. Such changes in reaction conditions include, but are not limited to, an increase in temperature or change in pH. Such additives include, but are not limited to, accelerants. [00134] The phrase \"stringent hybridization conditions\" refers to hybridization of sequences of DNA, RNA, PNA or other nucleic acid mimics, or combinations thereof, under conditions of low ionic strength and high temperature. By way of example, under stringent conditions a probe will hybridize to its target subsequence in a complex mixture of nucleic acid (including but not limited to, total cellular or library DNA or RNA) but does not hybridize to other sequences in the complex mixture. Stringent conditions are sequence-dependent and will be different in different circumstances. By way of example, longer sequences hybridize specifically at higher temperatures. Stringent hybridization conditions include, but are not limited to, (i) about 5-10 0 C lower than the thermal melting point (Tm) for the specific sequence at a defined ionic strength and pH; (ii) the salt concentration is about 0.01 M to about 1.0 M at about pH 7.0 to about pH 8.3 and the temperature is at least about 30 0 C for short probes (including but not limited to, about 10 to about 50 nucleotides) and at least about 60 0 C for long probes (including but not limited to, greater than 50 nucleotides); (iii) the addition of destabilizing agents including, but not limited to, formamide, (iv) 50% formamide, 5X SSC, and 1% SDS, incubating at 42 0 C, or 5X SSC, about 1% SDS, incubating at 65 0 C, with wash in 0.2X SSC, and about 0.l1% SDS at 65 0 C for between about 5 minutes to about 120 minutes.

Further, substitution with isotopes such as deuterium, i.e., 2 H, can afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements. [00148] Some of the compounds herein (including, but not limited to non-natural amino acids, non-natural amino acid polypeptides and modified non-natural amino acid polypeptides, and reagents for producing the aforementioned compounds) have asymmetric carbon atoms and can therefore exist as enantiomers or diastereomers.

Some of the compounds herein (including, but not limited to non-natural amino acids, non-natural amino acid polypeptides and modified non-natural amino acid polypeptides and reagents for producing the aforementioned compounds) can be basic and accordingly, may form a salt with a pharmaceutically acceptable anion. All such salts, including di-salts are within the scope of the compositions described herein and they can be prepared by conventional methods. For example, salts can be prepared by contacting the acidic and basic entities, in either an aqueous, non-aqueous or partially aqueous medium. The salts are recovered by using at least one of the following techniques: filtration, precipitation with a non-solvent followed by filtration, evaporation of the solvent, or, in the case of aqueous solutions, lyophilization. [00153] Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the non-natural amino acid polypeptides disclosed herein may be formed when an acidic proton present in the parent non-natural amino acid polypeptides either is replaced by a metal ion, by way of example an alkali metal ion, an alkaline earth ion, or an aluminum ion; or coordinates with an organic base.

[00156] It should be understood that a reference to a salt includes the solvent addition forms or crystal forms thereof, particularly solvates or polymorphs. Solvates contain either stoichiometric or non stoichiometric amounts of a solvent, and are often formed during the process of crystallization with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol, and the like. Hydrates are formed when the solvent is water, or alcoholates are formed when the solvent is alcohol. Polymorphs include the different crystal packing arrangements of the same elemental composition of a compound. Polymorphs usually have different X-ray diffraction patterns, infrared spectra, melting points, density, hardness, crystal shape, optical and electrical properties, stability, and solubility. Various factors such as the recrystallization solvent, rate of crystallization, and storage temperature may cause a single crystal form to dominate. [00157]The screening and characterization of non-natural amino acid polypeptide pharmaceutical acceptable salts polymorphs and/or solvates may be accomplished using a variety of techniques including, but not limited to, thermal analysis, x-ray diffraction, spectroscopy, vapor sorption, and microscopy.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION [00177] While preferred embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described herein, it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that such embodiments are provided by way of example only. Numerous variations, changes, and substitutions will now occur to those skilled in the art without departing from the invention. It should be understood that various alternatives to the embodiments of the invention described herein may be employed in practicing the invention. It is intended that the following claims define the scope of the invention and that methods and structures within the scope of these claims and their equivalents be covered thereby. I. Introduction [00178] Recently, an entirely new technology in the protein sciences has been reported, which promises to overcome many of the limitations associated with site-specific modifications of proteins. Specifically, new components have been added to the protein biosynthetic machinery of the prokaryote Escherichia coli (E. coli) (e.g., L. Wang, et al., (2001), Science 292:498-500) and the eukaryote Sacchromyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae) (e.g., J. Chin et al., Science 301:964-7 (2003)), which has enabled the incorporation of non-natural amino acids to proteins in vivo. A number of new amino acids with novel chemical, physical or biological properties, including photoaffinity labels and photoisomerizable amino acids, keto amino acids, and glycosylated amino acids have been incorporated efficiently and with high fidelity into proteins in E. coli and in yeast in response to the amber codon, TAG, using this methodology. Studies have demonstrated that it is possible to selectively and routinely introduce chemical functional groups that are not found in proteins, that are chemically inert to all of the functional groups found in the 20 common, genetically-encoded amino acids and that may be used to react efficiently and selectively to form stable covalent linkages. H. Overview [00179] At one level, described herein are the tools (methods, compositions, techniques) for creating and using dolastatin linker derivatives or analogs comprising at least one carbonyl, dicarbonyl, oxime, hydroxylamine, aldehyde, protected aldehyde, ketone, protected ketone, thioester, ester, dicarbonyl, hydrazine, azide, amidine, imine, diamine, keto-amine, keto-alkyne, alkyne, cycloalkyne, or ene-dione. At another level, described herein are the tools (methods, compositions, techniques) for creating and using dolastatin linker derivatives or analogs comprising at least one non-natural amino acid or modified non natural amino acid with an oxime, aromatic amine, heterocycle (e.g., indole, quinoxaline, phenazine, pyrazole, triazole, etc.). 41 WO 2012/166559 PCT/US2012/039468 [00180] Such dolastatin linker derivatives comprising non-natural amino acids may contain further functionality, including but not limited to, a polymer; a water-soluble polymer; a derivative of polyethylene glycol; a second protein or polypeptide or polypeptide analog; an antibody or antibody fragment; and any combination thereof. Note that the various aforementioned functionalities are not meant to imply that the members of one functionality cannot be classified as members of another functionality. Indeed, there will be overlap depending upon the particular circumstances. By way of example only, a water-soluble polymer overlaps in scope with a derivative of polyethylene glycol, however the overlap is not complete and thus both functionalities are cited above. [00181] Provided herein in some embodiments, is a toxic group linker derivative comprising a carbonyl, dicarbonyl, oxime, hydroxylamine, aldehyde, protected aldehyde, ketone, protected ketone, thioester, ester, dicarbonyl, hydrazine, azide, amidine, imine, diamine, keto-amine, keto-alkyne, alkyne, cycloalkyne, or ene-dione. In some embodiments, the toxic group derivative comprises any of the linkers disclosed herein. In other embodiments, described herein are the tools (methods, compositions, techniques) for creating and using toxic group derivatives or analogs comprising at least one non-natural amino acid or modified non-natural amino acid with an oxime, aromatic amine, heterocycle (e.g., indole, quinoxaline, phenazine, pyrazole, triazole, etc.). [00182] In some embodiments, such toxic derivatives comprising non-natural amino acids may contain further functionality, including but not limited to, a polymer; a water-soluble polymer; a derivative of polyethylene glycol; a second protein or polypeptide or polypeptide analog; an antibody or antibody fragment; and any combination thereof. In specific embodiments, the toxic group is dolastatin or auristatin. In certain specific embodiments, the toxic group is dolastatin-10. Note that the various aforementioned functionalities are not meant to imply that the members of one functionality cannot be classified as members of another functionality. Indeed, there will be overlap depending upon the particular circumstances. By way of example only, a water-soluble polymer overlaps in scope with a derivative of polyethylene glycol, however the overlap is not complete and thus both functionalities are cited above. [00183] Certain embodiments of the present invention describe preparations of certain toxic moieties with linkers that reduce the toxicity of the moiety in vivo while the toxic moiety retains pharmacological activity. In some embodiments, the toxicity of the linked toxic group, when administered to an animal or human, is reduced or eliminated compared to the free toxic group or toxic group derivatives comprising labile linkages, while retaining pharmacological activity. In some embodiments, increased doses of the linked toxic group (e.g., dolastatin linker derivatives, non-natural amino acid linked dolastatin derivatives) may be administered to animals or humans with greater safety. In certain embodiments, the non-natural amino acid polypeptides linked to a toxic moiety (e.g., dolastatin derivative) provides in vitro and in vivo stability. In some embodiments, the non-natural amino acid polypeptides linked to a toxic moiety (e.g., dolastatin-10 derivative) are efficacious and less toxic compared to the free toxic moiety (e.g., dolastatin 10). 42 WO 2012/166559 PCT/US2012/039468 II. Dolastatin Linker Derivatives [00184] At one level, described herein are the tools (methods, compositions, techniques) for creating and using a dolastatin linker derivatives or analogs comprising at least one non-natural amino acid or modified non-natural amino acid with a carbonyl, dicarbonyl, oxime or hydroxylamine group. Such dolastatin linker derivatives comprising non-natural amino acids may contain further functionality, including but not limited to, a polymer; a water-soluble polymer; a derivative of polyethylene glycol; a second protein or polypeptide or polypeptide analog; an antibody or antibody fragment; and any combination thereof. Note that the various aforementioned functionalities are not meant to imply that the members of one functionality cannot be classified as members of another functionality. Indeed, there will be overlap depending upon the particular circumstances. By way of example only, a water-soluble polymer overlaps in scope with a derivative of polyethylene glycol, however the overlap is not complete and thus both functionalities are cited above. [00185] In one aspect are methods for selecting and designing a dolastatin linker derivative to be modified using the methods, compositions and techniques described herein. The new dolastatin linker derivative may be designed de novo, including by way of example only, as part of high-throughput screening process (in which case numerous polypeptides may be designed, synthesized, characterized and/or tested) or based on the interests of the researcher. The new dolastatin linker derivative may also be designed based on the structure of a known or partially characterized polypeptide. By way of example only, dolastatin has been the subject of intense study by the scientific community; a new compound may be designed based on the structure of dolastatin. The principles for selecting which amino acid(s) to substitute and/or modify are described separately herein. The choice of which modification to employ is also described herein, and can be used to meet the need of the experimenter or end user. Such needs may include, but are not limited to, manipulating the therapeutic effectiveness of the polypeptide, improving the safety profile of the polypeptide, adjusting the pharmacokinetics, pharmacologics and/or pharmacodynamics of the polypeptide, such as, by way of example only, increasing water solubility, bioavailability, increasing serum half-life, increasing therapeutic half-life, modulating immunogenicity, modulating biological activity, or extending the circulation time. In addition, such modifications include, by way of example only, providing additional functionality to the polypeptide, incorporating an antibody, and any combination of the aforementioned modifications. [00186] Also described herein are dolastatin linker derivatives that have or can be modified to contain an oxime, carbonyl, dicarbonyl, or hydroxylamine group. Included with this aspect are methods for producing, purifying, characterizing and using such dolastatin linker derivatives [00187] The dolastatin linker derivative may contain at least one, at least two, at least three, at least four, at least five, at least six, at least seven, at least eight, at least nine, or ten or more of a carbonyl or dicarbonyl group, oxime group, hydroxylamine group, or protected forms thereof. The dolastatin linker derivative can be the same or different, for example, there can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 43 WO 2012/166559 PCT/US2012/039468 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, or more different sites in the derivative that comprise 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, or more different reactive groups. A. Structure and Synthesis of Dolastatin Linker Derivatives: Electrophilic and Nucleophilic Groups [00188] Dolastatin derivatives with linkers containing a hydroxylamine (also called an aminooxy) group allow for reaction with a variety of electrophilic groups to form conjugates (including but not limited to, with PEG or other water soluble polymers). Like hydrazines, hydrazides and semicarbazides, the enhanced nucleophilicity of the aminooxy group permits it to react efficiently and selectively with a variety of molecules that contain carbonyl- or dicarbonyl-groups, including but not limited to, ketones, aldehydes or other functional groups with similar chemical reactivity. Whereas the result of reaction with a hydrazine group is the corresponding hydrazone, however, an oxime results generally from the reaction of an aminooxy group with a carbonyl- or dicarbonyl-containing group such as, by way of example, a ketones, aldehydes or other functional groups with similar chemical reactivity. In some embodiments, dolastatin derivatives with linkers comprising an azide, alkyne or cycloalkyne allow for linking of molecules via cycloaddition reactions (e.g., 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions, azide-alkyne Huisgen cycloaddition, etc.) [00189] Thus, in certain embodiments described herein are dolastatin derivatives with linkers comprising a hydroxylamine, aldehyde, protected aldehyde, ketone, protected ketone, thioester, ester, dicarbonyl, hydrazine, amidine, imine, diamine, keto-amine, keto-alkyne, and ene-dione hydroxylamine group, a hydroxylamine-like group (which has reactivity similar to a hydroxylamine group and is structurally similar to a hydroxylamine group), a masked hydroxylamine group (which can be readily converted into a hydroxylamine group), or a protected hydroxylamine group (which has reactivity similar to a hydroxylamine group upon deprotection).

Non-Natural Amino Acid Derivatives [00213] The non-natural amino acids used in the methods and compositions described herein have at least one of the following four properties: (1) at least one functional group on the sidechain of the non natural amino acid has at least one characteristics and/or activity and/or reactivity orthogonal to the chemical reactivity of the 20 common, genetically-encoded amino acids (i.e., alanine, arginine, asparagine, aspartic acid, cysteine, glutamine, glutamic acid, glycine, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, proline, serine, threonine, tryptophan, tyrosine, and valine), or at least orthogonal to the chemical reactivity of the naturally occurring amino acids present in the polypeptide that includes the non-natural amino acid; (2) the introduced non-natural amino acids are substantially chemically inert toward the 20 common, genetically-encoded amino acids; (3) the non-natural amino acid can be stably incorporated into a polypeptide, preferably with the stability commensurate with the naturally-occurring amino acids or under typical physiological conditions, and further preferably such incorporation can occur via an in vivo system; and (4) the non-natural amino acid includes an oxime functional group or a functional group that can be transformed into an oxime group by reacting with a reagent, preferably under conditions that do not destroy the biological properties of the polypeptide that includes the non-natural amino acid (unless of course such a destruction of biological properties is the purpose of the modification/transformation), or where the transformation can occur under aqueous conditions at a pH between about 4 and about 8, or where the reactive site on the non-natural amino acid is an electrophilic site. Any number of non-natural amino acids can be introduced into the polypeptide. Non-natural amino acids may also include protected or masked oximes or protected or masked groups that can be transformed into an oxime group after deprotection of the protected group or unmasking of the masked group. Non-natural amino acids may also include protected or masked carbonyl or dicarbonyl groups, which can be transformed into a carbonyl or dicarbonyl group after deprotection of the protected group or unmasking of the masked group and thereby are available to react with hydroxylamines or oximes to form oxime groups. [00214] Non-natural amino acids that may be used in the methods and compositions described herein include, but are not limited to, amino acids comprising a amino acids with novel functional groups, amino 50 WO 2012/166559 PCT/US2012/039468 acids that covalently or noncovalently interact with other molecules, glycosylated amino acids such as a sugar substituted serine, other carbohydrate modified amino acids, keto-containing amino acids, aldehyde containing amino acids, amino acids comprising polyethylene glycol or other polyethers, heavy atom substituted amino acids, chemically cleavable and/or photocleavable amino acids, amino acids with an elongated side chains as compared to natural amino acids, including but not limited to, polyethers or long chain hydrocarbons, including but not limited to, greater than about 5 or greater than about 10 carbons, carbon-linked sugar-containing amino acids, redox-active amino acids, amino thioacid containing amino acids, and amino acids comprising one or more toxic moiety. [00215] In some embodiments, non-natural amino acids comprise a saccharide moiety. Examples of such amino acids include N-acetyl-L-glucosaminyl-L-serine, N-acetyl-L-galactosaminyl-L-serine, N acetyl-L-glucosaminyl-L-threonine, N-acetyl-L-glucosaminyl-L-asparagine and O-mannosaminyl-L serine. Examples of such amino acids also include examples where the naturally-occurring N- or 0 linkage between the amino acid and the saccharide is replaced by a covalent linkage not commonly found in nature - including but not limited to, an alkene, an oxime, a thioether, an amide and the like. Examples of such amino acids also include saccharides that are not commonly found in naturally-occurring proteins such as 2-deoxy-glucose, 2-deoxygalactose and the like. [00216] The chemical moieties incorporated into polypeptides via incorporation of non-natural amino acids into such polypeptides offer a variety of advantages and manipulations of polypeptides. For example, the unique reactivity of a carbonyl or dicarbonyl functional group (including a keto- or aldehyde- functional group) allows selective modification of proteins with any of a number of hydrazine or hydroxylamine-containing reagents in vivo and in vitro. A heavy atom non-natural amino acid, for example, can be useful for phasing x-ray structure data. The site-specific introduction of heavy atoms using non-natural amino acids also provides selectivity and flexibility in choosing positions for heavy atoms. Photoreactive non-natural amino acids (including but not limited to, amino acids with benzophenone and arylazides (including but not limited to, phenylazide) side chains), for example, allow for efficient in vivo and in vitro photocrosslinking of polypeptides. Examples of photoreactive non-natural amino acids include, but are not limited to, p-azido-phenylalanine and p-benzoyl-phenylalanine. The polypeptide with the photoreactive non-natural amino acids may then be crosslinked at will by excitation of the photoreactive group-providing temporal control. In a non-limiting example, the methyl group of a non-natural amino can be substituted with an isotopically labeled, including but not limited to, with a methyl group, as a probe of local structure and dynamics, including but not limited to, with the use of nuclear magnetic resonance and vibrational spectroscopy. A. Structure and Synthesis of Non-Natural Amino Acid Derivatives: Carbonyl, Carbonyl like, Masked Carbonyl, and Protected Carbonyl Groups [00217] Amino acids with an electrophilic reactive group allow for a variety of reactions to link molecules via various chemical reactions, including, but not limited to, nucleophilic addition reactions.

[00250] The carbonyl or dicarbonyl functionality can be reacted selectively with a hydroxylamine containing reagent under mild conditions in aqueous solution to form the corresponding oxime linkage that is stable under physiological conditions. See, e.g., Jencks, W. P., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 81, 475-481 (1959); Shao, J. and Tam, J. P., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 117(14):3893-3899 (1995). Moreover, the unique reactivity of the carbonyl or dicarbonyl group allows for selective modification in the presence of the other amino acid side chains. See, e.g., Cornish, V. W., et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 118:8150-8151 (1996); Geoghegan, K. F. & Stroh, J. G., Bioconjug. Chem. 3:138-146 (1992); Mahal, L. K., et al., Science 276:1125-1128 (1997). [00251] The synthesis of p-acetyl-(+/-)-phenylalanine and m-acetyl-(+/-)-phenylalanine is described in Zhang, Z., et al., Biochemistry 42: 6735-6746 (2003), incorporated by reference. Other carbonyl- or dicarbonyl-containing amino acids can be similarly prepared. 72 WO 2012/166559 PCT/US2012/039468 [00252] In some embodiments, a polypeptide comprising a non-natural amino acid is chemically modified to generate a reactive carbonyl or dicarbonyl functional group. For instance, an aldehyde functionality useful for conjugation reactions can be generated from a functionality having adjacent amino and hydroxyl groups. Where the biologically active molecule is a polypeptide, for example, an N-terminal serine or threonine (which may be normally present or may be exposed via chemical or enzymatic digestion) can be used to generate an aldehyde functionality under mild oxidative cleavage conditions using periodate. See, e.g., Gaertner, et. al., Bioconjug. Chem. 3: 262-268 (1992); Geoghegan, K. & Stroh, J., Bioconjug. Chem. 3:138-146 (1992); Gaertner et al., J. Biol. Chem. 269:7224-7230 (1994). However, methods known in the art are restricted to the amino acid at the N-terminus of the peptide or protein. [00253] Additionally, by way of example a non-natural amino acid bearing adjacent hydroxyl and amino groups can be incorporated into a polypeptide as a \"masked\" aldehyde functionality. For example, 5-hydroxylysine bears a hydroxyl group adjacent to the epsilon amine. Reaction conditions for generating the aldehyde typically involve addition of molar excess of sodium metaperiodate under mild conditions to avoid oxidation at other sites within the polypeptide. The pH of the oxidation reaction is typically about 7.0. A typical reaction involves the addition of about 1.5 molar excess of sodium meta periodate to a buffered solution of the polypeptide, followed by incubation for about 10 minutes in the dark. See, e.g. U.S. Patent No. 6,423,685. B.

Also included with this aspect are compositions of and methods for producing, purifying, characterizing and using cells that can express such oligonucleotides that can be used to produce, at least in part, a dolastatin linker derivative containing at least one non-natural amino acid. [00275] Thus, dolastatin linker derivatives comprising at least one non-natural amino acid or modified non-natural amino acid with a carbonyl, dicarbonyl, alkyne, cycloalkyne, azide, oxime or hydroxylamine group are provided and described herein.

In some embodiments the co-translational or post-translational modification occurs via the cellular machinery (e.g., glycosylation, acetylation, acylation, lipid modification, palmitoylation, palmitate addition, phosphorylation, glycolipid-linkage modification, and the like), in many instances, such cellular-machinery-based co-translational or post-translational modifications occur at the naturally occurring amino acid sites on the polypeptide, however, in certain embodiments, the cellular-machinery-based co-translational or post-translational modifications occur on the non-natural amino acid site(s) on the polypeptide. [00276] In other embodiments, the post-translational modification does not utilize the cellular machinery, but the functionality is instead provided by attachment of a molecule (a polymer; a water-soluble polymer; a derivative of polyethylene glycol; a second protein or polypeptide or polypeptide analog; an antibody or antibody fragment; and any combination thereof) comprising a second reactive group to the at least one non-natural amino acid comprising a first reactive group (including but not limited to, non-natural amino acid containing a ketone, aldehyde, acetal, hemiacetal, alkyne, cycloalkyne, azide, oxime, or hydroxylamine functional group) utilizing chemistry methodology described herein, or others suitable for the particular reactive groups. In certain embodiments, the co-translational or post-translational modification is made in vivo in a eukaryotic cell or in a non-eukaryotic cell. In certain embodiments, the post-translational modification is made in vitro not utilizing the cellular machinery. Also included with this aspect are methods for producing, purifying, characterizing and using such dolastatin linker derivatives containing at least one such co-translationally or post-translationally modified non-natural amino acids. 90 WO 2012/166559 PCT/US2012/039468 [00277] Also included within the scope of the methods, compositions, strategies and techniques described herein are reagents capable of reacting with a dolastatin linker derivative (containing a carbonyl or dicarbonyl group, oxime group, alkyne, cycloalkyne, azide, hydroxylamine group, or masked or protected forms thereof) that is part of a polypeptide so as to produce any of the aforementioned post-translational modifications. In certain embodiments, the resulting post-translationally modified dolastatin linker derivative will contain at least one oxime group; the resulting modified oxime-containing dolastatin linker derivative may undergo subsequent modification reactions. Also included with this aspect are methods for producing, purifying, characterizing and using such reagents that are capable of any such post translational modifications of such dolastatin linker derivative(s). [00278] In certain embodiments, the polypeptide or non-natural amino acid linked dolastatin derivative includes at least one co-translational or post-translational modification that is made in vivo by one host cell, where the post-translational modification is not normally made by another host cell type. In certain embodiments, the polypeptide includes at least one co-translational or post-translational modification that is made in vivo by a eukaryotic cell, where the co-translational or post-translational modification is not normally made by a non-eukaryotic cell. Examples of such co-translational or post-translational modifications include, but are not limited to, glycosylation, acetylation, acylation, lipid-modification, palmitoylation, palmitate addition, phosphorylation, glycolipid-linkage modification, and the like. In one embodiment, the co-translational or post-translational modification comprises attachment of an oligosaccharide to an asparagine by a GlcNAc-asparagine linkage (including but not limited to, where the oligosaccharide comprises (GlcNAc-Man) 2 -Man-GlcNAc-GlcNAc, and the like). In another embodiment, the co-translational or post-translational modification comprises attachment of an oligosaccharide (including but not limited to, Gal-GalNAc, Gal-GlcNAc, etc.) to a serine or threonine by a GalNAc serine, a GalNAc-threonine, a GlcNAc-serine, or a GlcNAc-threonine linkage. In certain embodiments, a protein or polypeptide can comprise a secretion or localization sequence, an epitope tag, a FLAG tag, a polyhistidine tag, a GST fusion, and/or the like. Also included with this aspect are methods for producing, purifying, characterizing and using such polypeptides containing at least one such co-translational or post translational modification. In other embodiments, the glycosylated non-natural amino acid polypeptide is produced in a non-glycosylated form. Such a non-glycosylated form of a glycosylated non-natural amino acid may be produced by methods that include chemical or enzymatic removal of oligosaccharide groups from an isolated or substantially purified or unpurified glycosylated non-natural amino acid polypeptide; production of the non-natural amino acid in a host that does not glycosylate such a non-natural amino acid polypeptide (such a host including, prokaryotes or eukaryotes engineered or mutated to not glycosylate such a polypeptide), the introduction of a glycosylation inhibitor into the cell culture medium in which such a non-natural amino acid polypeptide is being produced by a eukaryote that normally would glycosylate such a polypeptide, or a combination of any such methods. Also described herein are such non-glycosylated forms of normally-glycosylated non-natural amino acid polypeptides (by normally 91 WO 2012/166559 PCT/US2012/039468 glycosylated is meant a polypeptide that would be glycosylated when produced under conditions in which naturally-occurring polypeptides are glycosylated). Of course, such non-glycosylated forms of normally glycosylated non-natural amino acid polypeptides (or indeed any polypeptide described herein) may be in an unpurified form, a substantially purified form, or in an isolated form. [00279] In certain embodiments, the non-natural amino acid polypeptide includes at least one post translational modification that is made in the presence of an accelerant, wherein the post-translational modification is stoichiometric, stoichiometric-like, or near-stoichiometric. In other embodiments the polypeptide is contacted with a reagent of Formula (XIX) in the presence of an accelerant. In other embodiments the accelerant is selected from the group consisting of: N H 2 0 JOH ~JSH OH rlZ, NH 2 \nNH\n2 \nNH\n2 \nNH\n2 OH N NH 2 N N H2N N H 2 N OH OHHI H2 SH H 2 N OH N, H2HO H N Iand N A. Chemical Synthesis of Non-Natural Amino Acid Linked Dolastatin Derivatives: Oxime Containing Linked Dolastatin Derivatives [00280] Non-natural amino acid dolastatin linked derivatives containing an oxime group allow for reaction with a variety of reagents that contain certain reactive carbonyl- or dicarbonyl- groups (including but not limited to, ketones, aldehydes, or other groups with similar reactivity) to form new non-natural amino acids comprising a new oxime group. Such an oxime exchange reaction allows for the further functionalization of dolastatin linked derivatives.

B. Chemical Structure and Synthesis of Non-Natural Amino Acid Linked Dolastatin Derivatives: Alkylated Aromatic Amine Linked Dolastatin Derivatives [00293] In one aspect are dolastatin linker derivatives for the chemical derivatization of non-natural amino acids based upon the reactivity of an aromatic amine group. In further or additional embodiments, at least one of the aforementioned non-natural amino acids is incorporated into a dolastatin linker derivative, that is, such embodiments are non-natural amino acid linked dolastatin derivatives. In further or additional embodiments, the dolastatin linker derivatives are functionalized on their sidechains such that their reaction with a derivatizing non-natural amino acid generates an amine linkage. In further or additional embodiments, the dolastatin linker derivatives are selected from dolastatin linker derivatives having aromatic amine sidechains. In further or additional embodiments, the dolastatin linker derivatives comprise a masked sidechain, including a masked aromatic amine group. In further or additional embodiments, the non-natural amino acids are selected from amino acids having aromatic amine sidechains. In further or additional embodiments, the non-natural amino acids comprise a masked sidechain, including a masked aromatic amine group. [00294] In another aspect are carbonyl-substituted dolastatin linker derivatives such as, by way of example, aldehydes, and ketones, for the production of derivatized non-natural amino acid polypeptides based upon an amine linkage. In a further embodiment are aldehyde-substituted dolastatin linker derivatives used to derivatize aromatic amine-containing non-natural amino acid polypeptides via the formation of an amine linkage between the derivatizing dolastatin linker and the aromatic amine containing non-natural amino acid polypeptide. [00295] In further or additional embodiments, the non-natural amino acids comprise aromatic amine sidechains where the aromatic amine is selected from an aryl amine or a heteroaryl amine. In a further or additional embodiment, the non-natural amino acids resemble a natural amino acid in structure but contain aromatic amine groups. In another or further embodiment the non-natural amino acids resemble 95 WO 2012/166559 PCT/US2012/039468 phenylalanine or tyrosine (aromatic amino acids). In one embodiment, the non-natural amino acids have properties that are distinct from those of the natural amino acids. In one embodiment, such distinct properties are the chemical reactivity of the sidechain; in a further embodiment this distinct chemical reactivity permits the sidechain of the non-natural amino acid to undergo a reaction while being a unit of a polypeptide even though the sidechains of the naturally-occurring amino acid units in the same polypeptide do not undergo the aforementioned reaction. In a further embodiment, the sidechain of the non-natural amino acid has a chemistry orthogonal to those of the naturally-occurring amino acids. In a further embodiment, the sidechain of the non-natural amino acid comprises a nucleophile-containing moiety; in a further embodiment, the nucleophile-containing moiety on the sidechain of the non-natural amino acid can undergo a reaction to generate an amine-linked derivatized dolastatin. In a further embodiment, the sidechain of the non-natural amino acid comprises an electrophile-containing moiety; in a further embodiment, the electrophile-containing moiety on the sidechain of the non-natural amino acid can undergo nucleophilic attack to generate an amine-linked derivatized dolastatin. In any of the aforementioned embodiments in this paragraph, the non-natural amino acid may exist as a separate molecule or may be incorporated into a polypeptide of any length; if the latter, then the polypeptide may further incorporate naturally-occurring or non-natural amino acids. [00296] Modification of non-natural amino acids described herein using reductive alkylation or reductive amination reactions have any or all of the following advantages. First, aromatic amines can be reductively alkylated with carbonyl-containing compounds, including aldehydes, and ketones, in a pH range of about 4 to about 10 (and in certain embodiments in a pH range of about 4 to about 7) to generate substituted amine, including secondary and tertiary amine, linkages. Second, under these reaction conditions the chemistry is selective for non-natural amino acids as the sidechains of naturally occurring amino acids are unreactive. This allows for site-specific derivatization of polypeptides which have incorporated non-natural amino acids containing aromatic amine moieties or protected aldehyde moieties, including, by way of example, recombinant proteins. Such derivatized polypeptides and proteins can thereby be prepared as defined homogeneous products. Third, the mild conditions needed to effect the reaction of an aromatic amine moiety on an amino acid, which has been incorporated into a polypeptide, with an aldehyde-containing reagent generally do not irreversibly destroy the tertiary structure of the polypeptide (excepting, of course, where the purpose of the reaction is to destroy such tertiary structure). Similarly, the mild conditions needed to effect the reaction of an aldehyde moiety on an amino acid, which has been incorporated into a polypeptide and deprotected, with an aromatic amine-containing reagent generally do not irreversibly destroy the tertiary structure of the polypeptide (excepting, of course, where the purpose of the reaction is to destroy such tertiary structure). Fourth, the reaction occurs rapidly at room temperature, which allows the use of many types of polypeptides or reagents that would otherwise be unstable at higher temperatures. Fifth, the reaction occurs readily is aqueous conditions, again allowing use of polypeptides and reagents incompatible (to any extent) with non-aqueous solutions. Six, the 96 WO 2012/166559 PCT/US2012/039468 reaction occurs readily even when the ratio of polypeptide or amino acid to reagent is stoichiometric, stoichiometric-like, or near-stoichiometric, so that it is unnecessary to add excess reagent or polypeptide to obtain a useful amount of reaction product. Seventh, the resulting amine can be produced regioselectively and/or regiospecifically, depending upon the design of the amine and carbonyl portions of the reactants. Finally, the reductive alkylation of aromatic amines with aldehyde-containing reagents, and the reductive amination of aldehydes with aromatic amine containing reagents, generates amine, including secondary and tertiary amine, linkages which are stable under biological conditions. [00297] Non-natural amino acids with nucleophilic reactive groups, such as, by way of example only, an aromatic amine group (including secondary and tertiary amine groups), a masked aromatic amine group (which can be readily converted into a aromatic amine group), or a protected aromatic amine group (which has reactivity similar to a aromatic amine group upon deprotection) allow for a variety of reactions to link molecules via various reactions, including but not limited to, reductive alkylation reactions with aldehyde containing dolastatin linked derivatives. Such alkylated non-natural amino acid linked dolastatin derivatives include amino acids having the structure of Formula (XXV): Me Me Me 0 Me H H N Me N-LN N N H N Me \n(R\n1 N £H (R6nN, R7 O Me OMe O XV 'R, Me Me MMeO NH (XXV) 0 Z 0 R 2 wherein: Z has the structure of: R6 / - Ar R5; \nR\n5 is H, CO 2 H, CI-C 6 alkyl, or thiazole; \nR\n6 is OH or H; Ar is phenyl or pyridine; R is H, an amino protecting group, resin, at least one amino acid, polypeptide, or polynucleotide; \nR\n2 is OH, an ester protecting group, resin, at least one amino acid, polypeptide, or polynucleotide; \nR\n4 is H, halogen, lower alkyl, or substituted lower alkyl; \nR\n7 is CI-C 6 alkyl or hydrogen; L is-alkylene- or -(alkylene-0).-alkylene-; n is an integer greater than or equal to one; and each R 16 is independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, halogen, alkyl, NO 2 , CN, and substituted alkyl. 97 WO 2012/166559 PCT/US2012/039468 Such alkylated non-natural amino acid linked dolastatin derivatives may also be in the form of a salt, or may be incorporated into a non-natural amino acid polypeptide, polymer, polysaccharide, or a polynucleotide and optionally reductively alkylated.

[00307] In some embodiments, the masked amine moieties of non-natural amino acids contained in polypeptides are initially reduced to give non-natural amino acids containing aromatic amine moieties incorporated into non-natural amino acid polypeptides.

[00317] Provided herein in certain embodiments are derivatizing molecules for the production of toxic compounds comprising non-natural amino acid polypeptides based upon triazole linkages. In some embodiments, the reaction between the first and second reactive groups can proceed via a dipolarophile reaction. In certain embodiments, the first reactive group can be an azide and the second reactive group can be an alkyne. In further or alternative embodiments, the first reactive group can be an alkyne and the second reactive group can be an azide. In some embodiments, the Huisgen cycloaddition reaction (see, e.g., Huisgen, in 1,3-DIPOLAR CYCLOADDITION CHEMISTRY, (ed. Padwa, A., 1984), p. 1-176) provides for the incorporation of non-naturally encoded amino acids bearing azide and alkyne-containing side chains permits the resultant polypeptides to be modified with extremely high selectivity. In certain embodiments, both the azide and the alkyne functional groups are inert toward the twenty common amino acids found in naturally-occurring polypeptides. When brought into close proximity, however, the \"spring-loaded\" nature of the azide and alkyne groups is revealed and they react selectively and efficiently via Huisgen [3 2] cycloaddition reaction to generate the corresponding triazole. See, e.g., Chin et al., Science 301:964-7 (2003); Wang et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 125, 3192-3193 (2003); Chin et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 124:9026-9027 (2002). Cycloaddition reaction involving azide or alkyne-containing polypeptides can be carried out at room temperature under aqueous conditions by the addition of Cu(II) (e.g., in the form of a catalytic amount of CuSO 4 ) in the presence of a reducing agent for reducing Cu(II) to Cu(I), in situ, in catalytic amount. See, e.g., Wang et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 125, 3192-3193 (2003); Tornoe et al., J. Org. Chem. 67:3057-3064 (2002); Rostovtsev, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 41:2596-2599 (2002). Preferred reducing agents include ascorbate, metallic copper, quinine, hydroquinone, vitamin K, glutathione, cysteine, Fe 2 , Co 2 , and an applied electric potential.

[00328] The formation of such non-natural amino acid heterocycle-linked dolastatin derivatives having the structure of Formula (XXXI) includes, but is not limited to, (i) reactions of diamine-containing non natural amino acids with dicarbonyl-containing dolastatin linked derivatives or reactions of diamine containing non-natural amino acids with ketoalkyne-containing dolastatin linked derivatives, (ii) reactions of dicarbonyl-containing non-natural amino acids with either diamine-containing dolastatin linked derivatives or reactions of dicarbonyl-containing non-natural amino acids with ketoamine-containing dolastatin linked derivatives, (iii) reactions of ketoalkyne-containing non-natural amino acids with diamine-containing dolastatin linked derivatives, or (iv) reactions of ketoamine-containing non-natural amino acids with dicarbonyl-containing v. [00329] Modification of dolastatin linked derivatives described herein with such reactions have any or all of the following advantages. First, diamines undergo condensation with dicarbonyl-containing compounds in a pH range of about 5 to about 8 (and in further embodiments in a pH range of about 4 to about 10, in other embodiments in a pH range of about 3 to about 8, in other embodiments in a pH range of about 4 to about 9, and in further embodiments a pH range of about 4 to about 9, in other embodiments a pH of about 4, and in yet another embodiment a pH of about 8) to generate heterocycle, including a nitrogen containing heterocycle, linkages. Under these conditions, the sidechains of the naturally occurring amino acids are unreactive. Second, such selective chemistry makes possible the site-specific derivatization of 107 WO 2012/166559 PCT/US2012/039468 recombinant proteins: derivatized proteins can now be prepared as defined homogeneous products. Third, the mild conditions needed to effect the reaction of the diamines described herein with the dicarbonyl containing polypeptides described herein generally do not irreversibly destroy the tertiary structure of the polypeptide (excepting, of course, where the purpose of the reaction is to destroy such tertiary structure). Fourth, the reaction occurs rapidly at room temperature, which allows the use of many types of polypeptides or reagents that would be unstable at higher temperatures. Fifth, the reaction occurs readily is aqueous conditions, again allowing use of polypeptides and reagents incompatible (to any extent) with non-aqueous solutions. Six, the reaction occurs readily even when the ratio of polypeptide or amino acid to reagent is stoichiometric, near stoichiometric, or stoichiometric-like, so that it is unnecessary to add excess reagent or polypeptide to obtain a useful amount of reaction product. Seventh, the resulting heterocycle can be produced regioselectively and/or regiospecifically, depending upon the design of the diamine and dicarbonyl portions of the reactants. Finally, the condensation of diamines with dicarbonyl containing molecules generates heterocycle, including a nitrogen-containing heterocycle, linkages which are stable under biological conditions. VI. Location of non-natural amino acids in dolastatin linker derivatives [00330] The methods and compositions described herein include incorporation of one or more non-natural amino acids into a dolastatin linker derivative. One or more non-natural amino acids may be incorporated at one or more particular positions which do not disrupt activity of the dolastatin linker derivative. This can be achieved by making \"conservative\" substitutions, including but not limited to, substituting hydrophobic amino acids with non-natural or natural hydrophobic amino acids, bulky amino acids with non-natural or natural bulky amino acids, hydrophilic amino acids with non-natural or natural hydrophilic amino acids) and/or inserting the non-natural amino acid in a location that is not required for activity. [00331]A variety of biochemical and structural approaches can be employed to select the desired sites for substitution with a non-natural amino acid within the dolastatin linker derivative. In some embodiments, the non-natural amino acid is linked at the C-terminus of the dolastatin derivative. In other embodiments, the non-natural amino acid is linked at the N-terminus of the dolastatin derivative. Any position of the dolastatin linker derivative is suitable for selection to incorporate a non-natural amino acid, and selection may be based on rational design or by random selection for any or no particular desired purpose. Selection of desired sites may be based on producing a non-natural amino acid polypeptide (which may be further modified or remain unmodified) having any desired property or activity, including but not limited to a receptor binding modulators, receptor activity modulators, modulators of binding to binder partners, binding partner activity modulators, binding partner conformation modulators, dimer or multimer formation, no change to activity or property compared to the native molecule, or manipulating any physical or chemical property of the polypeptide such as solubility, aggregation, or stability. Alternatively, the sites identified as critical to biological activity may also be good candidates for substitution with a non-natural amino acid, again depending on the desired activity sought for the 108 WO 2012/166559 PCT/US2012/039468 polypeptide. Another alternative would be to simply make serial substitutions in each position on the polypeptide chain with a non-natural amino acid and observe the effect on the activities of the polypeptide. Any means, technique, or method for selecting a position for substitution with a non-natural amino acid into any polypeptide is suitable for use in the methods, techniques and compositions described herein. [00332] The structure and activity of naturally-occurring mutants of a polypeptide that contain deletions can also be examined to determine regions of the protein that are likely to be tolerant of substitution with a non-natural amino acid. Once residues that are likely to be intolerant to substitution with non-natural amino acids have been eliminated, the impact of proposed substitutions at each of the remaining positions can be examined using methods including, but not limited to, the three-dimensional structure of the relevant polypeptide, and any associated ligands or binding proteins. X-ray crystallographic and NMR structures of many polypeptides are available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB, www .reb~r), a centralized database containing three-dimensional structural data of large molecules of proteins and nucleic acids, one can be used to identify amino acid positions that can be substituted with non-natural amino acids. . In addition, models may be made investigating the secondary and tertiary structure of polypeptides, if three-dimensional structural data is not available. Thus, the identity of amino acid positions that can be substituted with non-natural amino acids can be readily obtained. [00333] Exemplary sites of incorporation of a non-natural amino acid include, but are not limited to, those that are excluded from potential receptor binding regions, or regions for binding to binding proteins or ligands may be fully or partially solvent exposed, have minimal or no hydrogen-bonding interactions with nearby residues, may be minimally exposed to nearby reactive residues, and/or may be in regions that are highly flexible as predicted by the three-dimensional crystal structure of a particular polypeptide with its associated receptor, ligand or binding proteins. [00334] A wide variety of non-natural amino acids can be substituted for, or incorporated into, a given position in a polypeptide. By way of example, a particular non-natural amino acid may be selected for incorporation based on an examination of the three dimensional crystal structure of a polypeptide with its associated ligand, receptor and/or binding proteins, a preference for conservative substitutions [00335] In one embodiment, the methods described herein include incorporating into the dolastatin linker derivative, where the dolastatin linker derivative comprises a first reactive group; and contacting the dolastatin linker derivative with a molecule (including but not limited to a second protein or polypeptide or polypeptide analog; an antibody or antibody fragment; and any combination thereof) that comprises a second reactive group. In certain embodiments, the first reactive group is a hydroxylamine moiety and the second reactive group is a carbonyl or dicarbonyl moiety, whereby an oxime linkage is formed. In certain embodiments, the first reactive group is a carbonyl or dicarbonyl moiety and the second reactive group is a hydroxylamine moiety, whereby an oxime linkage is formed. In certain embodiments, the first reactive group is a carbonyl or dicarbonyl moiety and the second reactive group is an oxime moiety, whereby an 109 WO 2012/166559 PCT/US2012/039468 oxime exchange reaction occurs. In certain embodiments, the first reactive group is an oxime moiety and the second reactive group is carbonyl or dicarbonyl moiety, whereby an oxime exchange reaction occurs. [00336] In some cases, the dolastatin linker derivative incorporation(s) will be combined with other additions, substitutions, or deletions within the polypeptide to affect other chemical, physical, pharmacologic and/or biological traits. In some cases, the other additions, substitutions or deletions may increase the stability (including but not limited to, resistance to proteolytic degradation) of the polypeptide or increase affinity of the polypeptide for its appropriate receptor, ligand and/or binding proteins. In some cases, the other additions, substitutions or deletions may increase the solubility (including but not limited to, when expressed in E. coli or other host cells) of the polypeptide. In some embodiments sites are selected for substitution with a naturally encoded or non-natural amino acid in addition to another site for incorporation of a non-natural amino acid for the purpose of increasing the polypeptide solubility following expression in E coli, or other recombinant host cells. In some embodiments, the polypeptides comprise another addition, substitution, or deletion that modulates affinity for the associated ligand, binding proteins, and/or receptor, modulates (including but not limited to, increases or decreases) receptor dimerization, stabilizes receptor dimers, modulates circulating half-life, modulates release or bio availability, facilitates purification, or improves or alters a particular route of administration. Similarly, the non-natural amino acid polypeptide can comprise chemical or enzyme cleavage sequences, protease cleavage sequences, reactive groups, antibody-binding domains (including but not limited to, FLAG or poly-His) or other affinity based sequences (including but not limited to, FLAG, poly-His, GST, etc.) or linked molecules (including but not limited to, biotin) that improve detection (including but not limited to, GFP), purification, transport thru tissues or cell membranes, prodrug release or activation, size reduction, or other traits of the polypeptide.

[00338]In one embodiment is a method for treating solid tumor which overexpresses HER-2 selected from the group consisting of breast cancer, small cell lung carcinoma, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, gastric carcinoma, cervical cancer, esophageal carcinoma, and colon cancer. In another embodiment, the solid tumor is breast cancer. In a further embodiment the solid tumor is ovarian cancer. [00339] Thus, the following description of trastuzumab is provided for illustrative purposes and by way of example only, and not as a limit on the scope of the methods, compositions, strategies and techniques described herein. Further, reference to trastuzumab in this application is intended to use the generic term as an example of any antibody. Thus, it is understood that the modifications and chemistries described herein with reference to trastuzumab can be equally applied to any antibody or monoclonal antibody, including those specifically listed herein. [00340] Trastuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to the domain IV of the extracellular segment of the HER2/neu receptor. The HER2 gene (also known as HER2/neu and ErbB2 gene) is amplified in 20-30% of early-stage breast cancers, which makes it overexpressed. Also, in cancer, HER2 may send signals without mitogens arriving and binding to any receptor, making it overactive. 111 WO 2012/166559 PCT/US2012/039468 [00341] HER2 extends through the cell membrane, and carries signals from outside the cell to the inside. In healthy people, signaling compounds called mitogens arrive at the cell membrane, and bind to the outside part of other members of the HER family of receptors. Those bound receptors then link (dimerize) with HER2, activating it. HER2 then sends a signal to the inside of the cell. The signal passes through different biochemical pathways. This includes the PI3K/Akt pathway and the MAPK pathway. These signals promote invasion, survival and growth of blood vessels (angiogenesis) of cells. [00342] Cells treated with trastuzumab undergo arrest during the Gi phase of the cell cycle so there is reduced proliferation. It has been suggested that trastuzumab induces some of its effect by downregulation of HER2/neu leading to disruption of receptor dimerization and signaling through the downstream P13K cascade. P27Kipl is then not phosphorylated and is able to enter the nucleus and inhibit cdk2 activity, causing cell cycle arrest. Also, trastuzumab suppresses angiogenesis by both induction of antiangiogenic factors and repression of proangiogenic factors. It is thought that a contribution to the unregulated growth observed in cancer could be due to proteolytic cleavage of HER2/neu that results in the release of the extracellular domain. Trastuzumab has been shown to inhibit HER2/neu ectodomain cleavage in breast cancer cells. VIII. Cellular uptake of non-natural amino acids [00343] Non-natural amino acid uptake by a eukaryotic cell is one issue that is typically considered when designing and selecting non-natural amino acids, including but not limited to, for incorporation into a protein. For example, the high charge density of a-amino acids suggests that these compounds are unlikely to be cell permeable. Natural amino acids are taken up into the eukaryotic cell via a collection of protein-based transport systems. A rapid screen can be done which assesses which non-natural amino acids, if any, are taken up by cells (examples 15 & 16 herein illustrate non-limiting examples of tests which can be done on non-natural amino acids). See, e.g., the toxicity assays in, e.g., the U.S. Patent Publication No. 2004/198637 entitled \"Protein Arrays,\" which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety, and Liu, D.R. & Schultz, P.G. (1999) Progress toward the evolution of an organism with an expanded genetic code. PNAS United States 96:4780-4785. Although uptake is easily analyzed with various assays, an alternative to designing non-natural amino acids that are amenable to cellular uptake pathways is to provide biosynthetic pathways to create amino acids in vivo. [00344] Typically, the non-natural amino acid produced via cellular uptake as described herein is produced in a concentration sufficient for efficient protein biosynthesis, including but not limited to, a natural cellular amount, but not to such a degree as to affect the concentration of the other amino acids or exhaust cellular resources. Typical concentrations produced in this manner are about 10 mM to about 0.05 mM. IX. Biosynthesis of Non-Natural Amino Acids 112 WO 2012/166559 PCT/US2012/039468 [00345] Many biosynthetic pathways already exist in cells for the production of amino acids and other compounds. While a biosynthetic method for a particular non-natural amino acid may not exist in nature, including but not limited to, in a cell, the methods and compositions described herein provide such methods. For example, biosynthetic pathways for non-natural amino acids can be generated in host cell by adding new enzymes or modifying existing host cell pathways. Additional new enzymes include naturally occurring enzymes or artificially evolved enzymes. For example, the biosynthesis of p aminophenylalanine (as presented in an example in WO 2002/085923 entitled \"In vivo incorporation of unnatural amino acids\") relies on the addition of a combination of known enzymes from other organisms. The genes for these enzymes can be introduced into a eukaryotic cell by transforming the cell with a plasmid comprising the genes. The genes, when expressed in the cell, provide an enzymatic pathway to synthesize the desired compound. Examples of the types of enzymes that are optionally added are provided herein. Additional enzymes sequences are found, for example, in Genbank. Artificially evolved enzymes can be added into a cell in the same manner. In this manner, the cellular machinery and resources of a cell are manipulated to produce non-natural amino acids. [00346] A variety of methods are available for producing novel enzymes for use in biosynthetic pathways or for evolution of existing pathways. For example, recursive recombination, including but not limited to, as developed by Maxygen, Inc. (available on the world wide web at www.maxygen.com), can be used to develop novel enzymes and pathways. See, e.g., Stemmer (1994), Rapid evolution of a protein in vitro by DNA shuffling, Nature 370(4):389-391; and, Stemmer, (1994), DNA shuffling by random fragmentation and reassembly: In vitro recombination for molecular evolution, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA., 91:10747-10751. Similarly DesignPath\nTM\n, developed by Genencor (available on the world wide web at genencor.com) is optionally used for metabolic pathway engineering, including but not limited to, to engineer a pathway to create a non-natural amino acid in a cell. This technology reconstructs existing pathways in host organisms using a combination of new genes, including but not limited to those identified through functional genomics, molecular evolution and design. Diversa Corporation (available on the world wide web at diversa.com) also provides technology for rapidly screening libraries of genes and gene pathways, including but not limited to, to create new pathways for biosynthetically producing non-natural amino acids. [00347] Typically, the non-natural amino acid produced with an engineered biosynthetic pathway as described herein is produced in a concentration sufficient for efficient protein biosynthesis, including but not limited to, a natural cellular amount, but not to such a degree as to affect the concentration of the other amino acids or exhaust cellular resources. Typical concentrations produced in vivo in this manner are about 10 mM to about 0.05 mM. Once a cell is transformed with a plasmid comprising the genes used to produce enzymes desired for a specific pathway and a non-natural amino acid is generated, in vivo selections are optionally used to further optimize the production of the non-natural amino acid for both ribosomal protein synthesis and cell growth. 113 WO 2012/166559 PCT/US2012/039468 X.

[00350] Non-limiting examples of carbon nucleophiles include, but are not limited to alkyl, alkenyl, aryl and alkynyl Grignard, organolithium, organozinc, alkyl-, alkenyl , aryl- and alkynyl-tin reagents (organostannanes), alkyl-, alkenyl-, aryl- and alkynyl-borane reagents (organoboranes and organoboronates); these carbon nucleophiles have the advantage of being kinetically stable in water or polar organic solvents. Other non-limiting examples of carbon nucleophiles include phosphorus ylids, enol and enolate reagents; these carbon nucleophiles have the advantage of being relatively easy to generate from precursors well known to those skilled in the art of synthetic organic chemistry. Carbon nucleophiles, when used in conjunction with carbon electrophiles, engender new carbon-carbon bonds between the carbon nucleophile and carbon electrophile. [00351] Non-limiting examples of non-carbon nucleophiles suitable for coupling to carbon electrophiles include but are not limited to primary and secondary amines, thiols, thiolates, and thioethers, alcohols, alkoxides, azides, semicarbazides, and the like. These non-carbon nucleophiles, when used in conjunction with carbon electrophiles, typically generate heteroatom linkages (C-X-C), wherein X is a hetereoatom, including, but not limited to, oxygen, sulfur, or nitrogen. 115 WO 2012/166559 PCT/US2012/039468 EXAMPLES Example 1: Synthesis of Compound 1 Scheme 1 0 OH O~H 0 HO O O O O -2 N'O NO O O O0H 0 1 DIAD, PPh 3 O 1-3 H H NC H ~ N0 H N O N' 0 OMeO OMeO N' S + Y 1-4 1-5 NaBH 3 CN N ON N 0 O OMe O OMe O 1-6 \nNH\n2\nNH\n2 H H \nH\n2 N,0 O O N NN O OMeO OMeO N [00352] Compound 1-3: Tetra (ethylene glycol) 1-1 (10g, 51.5mmol), N-hydroxyphthalimide 1-2 ( 8.4g, 51.15mmol) and triphenylphosphine ( 17.6g, 67mmol) were dissolved in 300 mL of tetrahydrofuran followed by addition of DIAD (12.8 mL, 61.78 mmol) at 0 0 C.

Flow rate was adjusted to 50 ul/min with HBS-EP as buffer. HerTox variants were injected for 3 min with 15 dissociation phase. 30sec pulse of 20mM HCl was used for regeneration. The Bivalent Analyte model was utilize to fit the data (Figure 1). Analysis of the data indicates that HerTox HA121-NC2D: Kd ~ 60 pM (chi2=4) and HerTox HA121-NC1D: Kd ~ 300 pM (chi2=14). Example 12: Transient Transfection [00383] CHO-S culture is seeded at 0.75xl0^6/mL approximately 16 hours pre-transfection in FreeStyle Cho medium. Cells are ready to transfect the next day when the cell count has reached 1.4 1.6x10^6/mL. When cells reach target count, 400 mM pAF stock is added to a 1.4mM final culture concentration. PEI/DNA complex is prepared as described: DNA (1.42 ug/1x1oA6 cells) is dissolved in RPMI (5% (v/v) of total culture volume), DNA/RPMI mixture is incubated at room temperature for 2 minutes, PEI stock (1 mg/mL) is added to DNA solution at a 3:1 ratio (mL PEI/ug DNA), and the mixture is incubated at room temperature for 5 min. The culture is gently added to the mixture and swirled. The flasks are transferred to a 32'C incubator. At day 6 post-transfection , a western blot analysis is performed. At day 7 post-transfection, the supernatant is harvested. Example 13: Anti-Her2 variant expression test [00384] 30 ml shaker cultures, CHO-S in FreeStyle medium; 56 ug DNA in PEI reagent were used. 1.5 mM pAF was also used. At day 6, the supernatant was harvested. Titer was determined by Fc ELISA. (Figures 2 and 3) Example 14: In vitro Inhibition of Proliferation Assay [00385] At day 1, the cells were seeded. The media was aspirated and the T-225 culture flasks of cells was rinsed with 30mL PBS -/. PBS was aspirated and 6 mL of 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA was added to each flask. The flasks were incubated at 37C, 5%CO2 for 2-5 minutes. Adherent cells were dislodged by hitting flask and trypsin was neutralized by adding 14mL culture medium. The cell suspension was mixed and transered to a 50 mL conical tube. The cells were spun down at 1200 rpm, 5 min, room temperature. The resultant cell pellet was resuspended in 12 mL of culture medium. The cells were counted in a hemacytometer. Cells were seeded at appropriate cell densities into 96-well flat-bottom, clear plates and incubated overnight at 37 0 C, 5% CO 2 to allow cells to attach. Plating volume was 80uL/well. 80uL/well of culture medium was utilized as the \"no cell\" control. 127 WO 2012/166559 PCT/US2012/039468 [00386] Cell plating density examples include: BT474 (high Her2) - 20,000 cells/well in F12k/DMEM (50/50), 10% FBS, P/S MDA-MB-468 (Her2 negative) - 6,000 cells/well in F12k/DMEM (50/50), 10% FBS, P/S HCC1954 - 5,000 cells/well in RPMI 1640, 10% FBS, P/S SKOV-3 - 6,000 cells/well in RPMI 1640, 10% FBS, P/S HT29 - 20,000 cells/well in McCoy' s 5A, 10% FBS, P/S [00387] At day 2, the test samples were added to the cells. The test samples were diluted in culture medium to a 9x stock concentration in Column 2 of a round-bottom 96-well plate. 3x serial dilutions were made from Column 2 to Column 11 with a multi-channel pipettor. 1OuL/well of the above samples was added in duplicate to the appropriate wells of the seeded plate. The total volume in the wells was about 90uL/well. 1 OuL/well of culture medium was added to avoid edge effects for sample wells. Media Control wells were included in the inner wells where no sample was added (just lOuL/well of culture medium) to be used in proliferation calculations. The plates were incubated at 37 0 C, 5%CO 2 for 72 hrs. [00388] At day 5, proliferation readout occurred. To detect cell proliferation, lOuL/well of WST-8 reagent was added (Cell Counting Kit-8, cat# CK04-20, Dojindo Labs) to all wells. The plate was incubated for 4 hrs at 37 0 C, 5%CO 2 . The plates were measured for absorbance at OD 450nm. Calculation of proliferation inhibition of test samples: subtract the \"no cell control\" OD450 value from all wells' OD450 values; calculate average of the Media Control (untreated) wells; calculate each sample's % Media Control value using the formula: (OD450 sample/OD450 avg % Media Control) *100; calculate the average, standard deviation, and %CV of each sample's duplicate % Media Control values; plot each samples average % Media Control value against sample concentration; calculate IC50 values using 4 parameter logistic fit regression analysis to determine potency of test samples.

Cells were harvested by trypsinization and suspended in PBS at 1 x 108 cells/mL. [00391] Female, SCID-beige mice, 5-8 weeks old, were obtained from Charles River Laboratories. HCC1954 cells (human, breast carcinoma, ATCC, # CRL-2338) were mixed 1:1 with Matrigel (BD Biosciences, Bedford MA) and injected subcutaneously into the mice. When tumors reached an average size of 100-200 nun, mice were soiled into groups of 9-10 mice each. Caliper measurements were taken twice weekly until the end of the study. To estimate tumor volume, two orthogonal diameters were measured with calipers and the values entered into the formula, (L x W x W)/2=V, (where W=the shortest diameter, L=the longest diameter and V=volume), to obtain an estimated volume. The tumor volume was converted to tumor weight in the Excel data file by assuming 1 mm 3 = 1 ing. Endpoint was based on a study design of tumor growth inhibition (TGI). When the mean tumor volume of the control group reached approx. 1,000 mm 3 all mice were euthanized or day 28, whichever came first. 130 WO 2012/166559 PCT/US2012/039468 [00392] Mice were given a single IV injection (tail vein) on day 1 of dosing. Test article was dissolved at 4 mg/mL, 2 mg/mL and 0.66 mg/mL and administered at a dose volume of 5 mL/kg to deliver 20, 10 and 3.3 mg/kg. Test articles were: Herceptin@ clinical grade (Trastuzumab), Her2-HS122 NCD1 (Ab:Drug ratio = 1:2, non-cleavable linker), and Her2-HS122/LK145-HCD1 (Ab:Drug ratio = 1:4, cleavable linker) See Figure 16. Example 16: In vivo Studies of Her2-Dolastatin linked Derivative [003931 HCC1954 cells were utilized for this study with 10 7 cells/mouse in Matrigel, SC in the right flank. Mice were SCID-bg female 4-8 weeks. Grouping was performed at day 5 after cell implantation (tumors ~100 mm 3 ): sorted into 11 groups of 10 mice each. A single IV dose was given on day 1 of dosing with each compound at 3 dose levels, 20 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg and 3.3 mg/kg. Tumor volume was monitored until the endpoint was reached (1,000 mm3 or 60 days). (Figure 10) Paclitaxel 25 mg/kg, IV, qod x 5 was employed as the control chemotherapy. The vehicle = 50 mM histamine, 0.1 M NaCl, 5% trehalose, pH 6. Herceptin@ clinical grade (Trastuzumab), Her2-HS122-NCD1 (non-cleavable linker) and Her2-HS122/LK145-HCD1 (cleavable linker) were tested. (Figures 1 land 12) Table 4.

Example 18: Treatment for Breast Cancer [00396] Human Clinical Trial of the Safety and/or Efficacy of Trastuzumab-Linked Dolastatin Derivative for Breast Cancer Therapy [00397] Objective: To compare the safety and pharmacokinetics of administered composition comprising trastuzumab-linked dolastatin derivative. [00398] Study Design: This study will be a Phase I, single-center, open-label, randomized dose escalation study followed by a Phase II study in breast cancer patients. Patients should not have had exposure to trastuzumab-linked dolastatin derivative prior to the study entry. Patients must not have received treatment for their cancer within 2 weeks of beginning the trial. Treatments include the use of chemotherapy, hematopoietic growth factors, and biologic therapy such as monoclonal antibodies. Patients must have recovered from all toxicities (to grade 0 or 1) associated with previous treatment. All subjects are evaluated for safety and all blood collections for pharmacokinetic analysis are collected as scheduled. All studies are performed with institutional ethics committee approval and patient consent. [00399] Phase I: Patients receive i.v. trastuzumab-linked dolastatin derivative on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle. Doses of trastuzumab-linked dolastatin derivative may be held or modified for toxicity based on assessments as outlined below. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of trastuzumab-linked dolastatin derivative until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for trastuzumab-linked dolastatin derivative is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Dose limiting toxicities are determined according to the definitions and standards set by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 3.0 (August 9, 2006). [00400] Phase II: Patients receive trastuzumab-linked dolastatin derivative as in phase I at the MTD determined in phase I. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 2-6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of 2 courses of study therapy, patients who achieve a complete or partial response may receive an additional 4 courses. Patients who maintain stable disease for more than 2 months after completion of 6 courses of study therapy may receive an additional 6 courses at the time of disease progression, provided they meet original eligibility criteria. [00401] Blood Sampling Serial blood is drawn by direct vein puncture before and after administration of trastuzumab-linked dolastatin derivative. Venous blood samples (5 mL) for determination of serum concentrations are obtained at about 10 minutes prior to dosing and at approximately the following times after dosing: days 1, 8, and 15. Each serum sample is divided into two aliquots. All serum samples are stored at -20 0 C. Serum samples are shipped on dry ice. [00402] Pharmacokinetics: Patients undergo plasma/serum sample collection for pharmacokinetic evaluation before beginning treatment and at days 1, 8, and 15. Pharmacokinetic parameters are 132 WO 2012/166559 PCT/US2012/039468 calculated by model independent methods on a Digital Equipment Corporation VAX 8600 computer system using the latest version of the BIOAVL software. The following pharmacokinetics parameters are determined: peak serum concentration (Cmax); time to peak serum concentration (tmax); area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) from time zero to the last blood sampling time (AUCo 7 2 ) calculated with the use of the linear trapezoidal rule; and terminal elimination half-life (t1/2), computed from the elimination rate constant. The elimination rate constant is estimated by linear regression of consecutive data points in the terminal linear region of the log-linear concentration-time plot. The mean, standard deviation (SD), and coefficient of variation (CV) of the pharmacokinetic parameters are calculated for each treatment. The ratio of the parameter means (preserved formulation/non-preserved formulation) is calculated. [00403] Patient Response to combination therapy: Patient response is assessed via imaging with X ray, CT scans, and MRI, and imaging is performed prior to beginning the study and at the end of the first cycle, with additional imaging performed every four weeks or at the end of subsequent cycles. Imaging modalities are chosen based upon the cancer type and feasibility/availability, and the same imaging modality is utilized for similar cancer types as well as throughout each patient's study course. Response rates are determined using the RECIST criteria. (Therasse et al, J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000 Feb 2; 92(3):205-16; http://ctep.cancer.gov/forms/TherasseRECISTJNCI.pdf). Patients also undergo cancer/tumor biopsy to assess changes in progenitor cancer cell phenotype and clonogenic growth by flow cytometry, Western blotting, and IHC, and for changes in cytogenetics by FISH. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 4 weeks. Example 19: Treatment for Breast Cancer [00404] Human Clinical Trial of the Safety and Efficacy of Trastuzumab-Linked Dolastatin Derivative for Breast Cancer Therapy [00405] Objective: Compare the efficacy and toxicity of trastuzumab-linked dolastatin derivative alone followed at disease progression by combination trastuzumab and paclitaxel vs first-line combination trastuzumab and paclitaxel in women with HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer. [00406] Study Design: This study is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to degree of HER2/neu-overexpression (2+ vs 3+), prior anthracycline-containing adjuvant treatment (no prior treatment vs prior treatment without radiotherapy to left chest wall vs prior treatment with radiotherapy to left chest wall), estrogen-receptor status (positive vs negative vs unknown), prior therapy (first-line vs second/third-line), and center. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive trastuzumab-linked dolastatin derivative IV over 30-90 minutes weekly. At time of disease progression, patients receive combination trastuzumab-linked dolastatin derivative IV and paclitaxel IV as in arm II. Arm II: Patients receive trastuzumab-linked dolastatin derivative IV over 30-90 minutes weekly. Paclitaxel is administered IV over 1 hour weekly for 3 weeks followed by 1 week of rest. 133 WO 2012/166559 PCT/US2012/039468 [00407] Treatment continues in both arms in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is assessed at baseline and day 1 of courses 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, and 12. Patients are followed at 1, 3, and 6 months and then every 6 months thereafter.

		"description": "Description\n\n\n =SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR SAMPLE USE MAXIMIZATION \n[0002]     The discovery of a vast number of disease biomarkers, new therapies and the establishment of miniaturized medical systems have opened up new avenues for the prediction, diagnosis and monitoring of treatment of diseases in a point-of-care or other distributed test settings. Point-of-care systems can rapidly deliver test results to medical personnel, other medical professionals and patients. Early diagnosis of a disease or disease progression and monitoring of therapy are often critical for treatment of deadly conditions such as certain cancers and infectious diseases. \n[0003]     Diagnosis and treatment of diseases can take advantage of multiplexed biomarker measurements, which provide additional knowledge of the condition of a patient. For example, when monitoring the effects of a drug, three or more biomarkers can be measured in parallel. Typically, microliter plates and other similar apparatuses have been used to perform multiplexed separation-based assays. A microtiter plate (for example, a 384 well microtiter plate) can perform a large number of assays in parallel. \n[0004]     In a Point-of-Care (POC) device, the number of assays that can be performed in parallel is often limited by the size of the device and the volume of the sample to be analyzed. In many POC devices, the number assays performed is about 1 to 10. A POC device capable of performing multiplexed assays on a small sample would be desirable. \n[0005]     A shortcoming of many multiplexed POC assay devices is the high cost of manufacturing the components of the device. If the device is disposable, the cost of the components can make the manufacturing of a POC device impractical. Further, for multiplexed POC devices that incorporate all of the necessary reagents onboard of the device, if any one of those reagents exhibit instability, an entire manufactured lot of devices may have to be discarded even if all the other reagents are still usable. \n[0006]     When a customer is interested in customizing a POC device to a particular set of analytes, manufacturers of multiplexed POC assay systems are often confronted with the need to mix and match the assays and reagents of the device. A multiplexed POC assay suitable to each customer can be very expensive, difficult to calibrate, and difficult to maintain quality control. \n[0007]     POC methods have proven to be very valuable in monitoring disease and therapy (for example, blood glucose systems in diabetes therapy, Prothrombin Time measurement in anticoagulant therapy using Warfarin). By measuring multiple markers, it is believed that complex diseases (such as cancer) for which multi-drug therapies are required can be better monitored and controlled. \n[0008]     There exists the need to use multiple sources of information for monitoring the health status or disease condition of individuals as well as treatments of various diseases. Especially important is the measurement of concentrations of several selected analytes (biomarkers, antibodies, gene expression levels, metabolites, therapeutic drug concentrations and the like) over time. To make this process convenient and -I-;A 028251962013-07-18 maximally effective, technologies that enable measurement of any and all needed analytes (of whatever typcs) using a small blood sample (blood drop obtained by finger-stick) or other suitable sample are particularly valuable. Such technology will ideally be operable by non-technically trained users in distributed test settings, e.g., homes, clinics, doctor's offices, pharmacies, and retail shops. The present invention addresses these issues and allows for one to be able to make such measurements routinely in patient's home or other non-laboratory setting. \n[0009]    There also exists the need to make the greatest use of available samples, particularly in the instance where samples (e.g., blood samples) are limited by sample size. Blood samples are used for the great majority of medical/clinical tests. Blood cells have to be separated from plasma (or serum) prior to most types of analysis since the presence of cells would compromise the assay chemistries. For example, glucose and cholesterol are often measured by color-forming chemistries which would be interfered with by the presence of formed elements, especially red cells, or hemoglobin (from lysed red cells). \n[0010]    Distributed test systems ideally require a small blood sample obtained by fingerstick methods. Such samples may be as small as 20 microliters (uL) (one drop) or less. Larger volume samples (say up to 200 uL) usually cannot be taken by fingerstick methods without repeated, inconvenient (\"milking\") of fingers. Alternatively venous samples of several milliliters (mL) can be taken but this requires a medically trained phlebotomist. \n[0011]    It is usually very difficult to perform more than a single assay using small blood sample with 20 uL or less. This is especially so when the blood sample has to be filtered to remove cells and the recovery of usable plasma from such small volumes is inefficient. Typically only about 5 uL or less of plasma can be recovered. Samples as large as 200 uL can be efficiently separated by automated POC systems (Abaxis, Biosite etc.) but this cannot be done routinely unless a technician is available to draw the sample.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION \n[0012]    In view of the limitations of current methods, there is a pressing need for improved methods of automatically separating plasma and/or other materials from blood cells. There is also a need for improved accuracy of these measurements on analyte concentration. In measurements of biomarkers and other components of blood for the purposes of monitoring therapy and diagnosis, it is important that the correct volume or sample be used. In a laboratory setting, this is achieved by utilizing complex automated instruments and skilled professional staff members. In contrast in \"point-of-care\" settings such as homes, retail pharmacies and shops, and the like, the methods and equipment used must enable non-technically trained people reliably to obtain and process samples. \n[0013]    The present invention addresses the aforementioned needs and provides related advantages. \n[0014]    In some embodiments, the present invention relates to point-of-care and/or point-of-service devices.

In another aspect, the present invention also allows for one to be able to correct for significant volume errors that occur in performing an assay.   ;A 028251962013-07-18 \n[0016]    In yet another aspect, this invention allows for simultaneous measurements on several analytes of different types with high accuracy. \n[0017]    An aspect of the invention may be directed to an automated system for separating one or more components in a biological fluid.

Numerous variations, changes, and substitutions will now occur to those skilled in the art without departing from the invention. It should be understood that various alternatives to the embodiments of the invention described herein can be employed in practicing the invention.[00186]    The invention provides mobile applications for system and methods for sample use maximization. Various aspects of the invention described herein may be applied to any of the particular applications set forth below or for any other types of diagnostic or therapeutic applications. The invention may be applied as a standalone system or method, or as part of an integrated pre-clinical, clinical, laboratory or medical application. It shall be understood that different aspects of the invention can be appreciated individually, collectively, or in combination with each other.[00187]    The devices and systems herein can provide an effective means for real-time detection of analytes present in a bodily fluid from a subject. The detection methods may be used in a wide variety of circumstances including identification and quantification of analytes that are associated with specific biological processes, physiological conditions, disorders or stages of disorders. As such, the systems have a broad spectrum of utility in, for example, drug screening, disease diagnosis, phylogenetic classification, parental and forensic identification, disease onset and recurrence, individual response to treatment versus population bases, and/or monitoring of therapy. The subject devices and systems are also particularly useful for advancing preclinical and clinical stage of development of therapeutics, improving patient compliance, monitoring ADRs associated with a prescribed drug, developing individualized medicine, outsourcing blood testing from the central laboratory to the home or on a prescription basis, and/or monitoring therapeutic agents following regulatory approval. The subject devices and system can be utilized by payors outsourcing blood tests from a central laboratory. The devices and systems can provide a flexible system for personalized medicine. Using the same system, a device can be changed or interchanged along with a protocol or instructions to a programmable processor of the ;A 028251962013-07-18 systems to perform a wide variety of assays as described. The systems and devices described herein, while being much smaller and/or portable, embody novel features and offer many functions of a laboratory instrument.[00188]    In an aspect, a system of the invention comprises a device comprising assay units and reagent units, which include reagents, e.g., both liquid and/or solid phase reagents. In some embodiments, at least one of the whole device, an assay unit, a reagent unit, or a combination thereof is disposable. In a system of the invention, the detection of an analyte with the subject device is typically automated. Such automation can be effected by a built-in protocol or a protocol provided to the system by the manufacturer.[00189]    The devices and systems as described herein can offer many features that are not available in existing POC systems or integrated analysis systems. For example, many POC cartridges rely on a closed fluidic system or loop to handle small volumes of liquid in an efficient manner. The fluidic devices such as cartridges described herein can have open fluid movement between units within a given cartridge. For example, a reagent can be stored in a unit, a sample stored in a sample collection unit, a diluent stored in a diluent unit, and the capture surface can be in an assay unit, where in one state of cartridge, none of the units are in fluid communication with any of the other units. The units can be movable relative to each other in order to bring some units into fluid communication using a fluid transfer device of the system. For example, a fluid transfer device can comprise a head that engages an assay unit and brings the assay unit in fluidic communication with a reagent unit. In some cases, the head is a pipette head that moves the assay unit (e.g., tip) in fluid communication with a reagent unit.[00190]    Accordingly, in an embodiment, the present invention provides a method of detecting and /or measuring the concentration of an analyte in a bodily fluid or tissue sample, the method typically comprises the steps of providing a sample (e.g., blood, urine, saliva, tissue) to a device or system of the invention, allowing the sample to react within at least one assay unit of the device, and detecting the detectable signal generated from the analyte in the blood sample.[00191]    One aspect of the invention provides for analyzing samples using a point-of-care device that is configured to maximize sample utilization. For example, more than about 15, 25, 50, 75, or 100 assays can be performed on a sample having a volume of less than about 1, 20, 50, 100, or 500 4. The sample can be a blood sample taken from a finger prick. The sample can be collected in a sealable capillary or tip. The sample can be prepared for one or more assays by subjecting the sample to a separation (e.g., centrifugation) and/or dilution process. The one or more assays can be prepared by combining the sample, which may have been separated and diluted, with one or more reagents in a reaction chamber. The reaction chamber can be a pipette tip, vial, a sample transfer device, and/or a cuvette. The one or more assays can be configured such that an optical signal can be measured which is indicative of the concentration of one or more analytes in the sample. The reaction chamber can contain a plurality of assays, which may be spatially separated. A plurality of optical signals can be generated within a single reaction chamber from one assay, or from a plurality of spatially separated assays. The one or more optical signals can be measured by a digital imaging camera that can measure a plurality of detection spectral regions or detection bands, e.g., red, green and blue. The optical signal can be measured on the assay reaction product in the reaction chamber, which can be a pipette tip or other sample containers. The systems, devices, and methods can be fully automated or semi-automated by prograrrunable logic.[00192]    Another aspect of the invention provides for systems, devices, and methods for preparing samples for analysis. Samples can be prepared for analysis by one or more separation devices. For example, a sample ;A 028251962013-07-18 can be prcparcd for analysis by centrifugation within a centrifuge. Other separations based on charge, size, hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity, andlor volatility can also be implemented.[00193]    One aspect of the invention provides for sample and reaction product analysis using image-based analysis. The system can include a camera that can measure an optical signal using one or more detection spectrum regions. For example, a camera can measure an optical signal using red, green, and blue detection spectrum regions. The measured signal can include three measured values that can be interpreted using one or more algorithms described herein. The use of more than one detection spectrum region can increase the dynamic range of an assay and can increase the accuracy of a measurement as compared to measurements using a single detection spectrum region.[00194]    The invention also provides for systems, devices, and methods for performing optical measurements on samples and assay reaction products that are contained within reaction chambers, each with a plurality of distinct path lengths. The reaction chambers can have a plurality of distinct path lengths such that a greater or lower amount of light absorbance is observed. The plurality of distinct path lengths (such as, for example, through the sample and/or reaction chamber) allows for an increase in the dynamic range of a selected assay protocol. The image of the reaction chamber can be analyzed as described herein to obtain information on the sample or the assay reaction products. The combination of utilizing the plurality of available path lengths within a single reaction chamber and the use of three channel detection spectrum regions greatly enhances the dynamic range of a given assay.[00195]    A system for performing sample preparation and analysis can include instrumentation, disposable components, and reagents. The system can accept samples and automatically performs a plurality of assays without user intervention. Where desired, the instrumentation can include a graphical user interface, a mechanism for introducing cartridges, which may be disposable, a motorized stage, which may have mobility in three dimensions, one or more single-head liquid handling devices, one or more multi-head liquid handling devices, one or more devices for performing sample preparation, optical sensors, which can include a PMT and/or an imaging device, temperature controllers, and communication devices. The disposable component can include a disposable cartridge that contains sample tips, tip seals, and reagents. In some embodiments, the disposable cartridge may also contain neutralizing assemblies configured to absorb and neutralize liquid assay products.[00196]    The instrumentation, disposable components, and reagents can be housed within a closeable environment, such as a case or a cabinet. In some embodiments, the case has a cross-sectional area less than about 4 m2, 2 m2, 1 m2, 0.5 m2, 0.1 m2, 0.05 m2, or lower. The invention provides for a distributed test system, such as a point-of-care device, which can include one or more of the following aspects:[00197]    1. Efficient (centrifugal) separation of blood and recovery of the separated plasma [00198]    2. Dilution of the plasma sample to one or more levels (for example 1:10, 1:100, 1:1000) so that each assay can be performed at an optimal dilution [00199]    3. Optimized distribution of sample to several different assays which may involve several different methodologies [00200]    4. Optimal assay protocols [00201]    5. Use of open-ended circular section cuvettes for sample analysis, mixing with reagents, incubation and presentation to optical systems ;A 028251962013-07-18 [00202]    6. Analysis of assays using imaging technology (scanning and/or photography, and/or microscopy) [00203]    In one embodiment, the device of the invention is self-contained and comprises all reagents, liquid- and solid-phase reagents, required to perform a plurality of assays in parallel. Where desired, the device is configured to perform at least 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000 or more assays. One or more control assays can also be incorporated into the device to be performed in parallel if desired.Calibrators can also be provided for assay system calibration. Some examples of dried controls and calibrators useful for assay system calibration can include aqueous solutions of analytes, serum, or plasma samples with known levels of analytes, known quantities of such calibrators and controls can also be dried by lyophilization, vacuum drying, and other manufacturing processes (and dissolved during the assay).[00204]    By incorporating these components within a point-of-care system, a patient or user can have a plurality of analytes, for example more than about 10, 20, 30, 50, 75, 100, 150, or 200 analytes, quantified within less than about 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 20, 30, 60, 120, 180, 240, 480 or 600 minutes.[00205]    The subject devices and systems can be utilized for conducting quantitative immunoassays, which can be completed in a short period of time. Other assay type can be performed with a device of the invention including, but not limited to, measurements of nucleic acid sequences and measurements of metabolite, such as cholesterol or electrolytes such as magnesium and chloride ions. In some embodiments, the assay is completed in no more than one hour, preferably less than 120, 60, 30, 15, 10, 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1 minute. In other embodiments, the assay is performed in less than 5 minutes. The duration of assay detection can be adjusted accordingly to the type of assay that is to be carried out with a device of the invention. For example, if needed for higher sensitivity, an assay can be incubated for more than one hour or up to more than one day. In some examples, assays that require a long duration may be more practical in other POC applications, such as home use, than in a clinical POC setting.[00206]    In other embodiments of the invention the reagent units of a subject device are configured to be a set of mix-mid-match components. A reagent unit typically stores liquid or solid reagents necessary for conducting an assay that detect a given analyte. The assay units can sometimes (or optionally not always) comprise at least one capture surface capable of reacting with an analyte from the sample of bodily fluid. The assay unit may be a tubular tip with a capture surface within the tip. Examples of tips of the invention are described herein. Each individual assay and reagent unit can be configured for assay function independently. To assemble a device, the units can be assembled in a just-in-time fashion for use in an integrated device, which can take the format of cartridge.[00207]    A housing for a device of the invention can be made of a polymeric material, a metallic material or a composite material, such as, e.g., aluminum, polystyrene or other moldable or machinable plastic, and can have defined locations to place assay units and reagent units. The housing may include a metal or any other material. The housing may partially or entirely enclose the assay units and/or reagent units. The housing may support the weight of the assay units and/or reagent units. In an embodiment, the housing has means for blotting tips or assay units to remove excess liquid. The means for blotting can be a porous membrane, such as cellulose acetate, or a piece bibulous material such as filter paper.[00208]    In some embodiments, at least one of the components of the device may be constructed of polymeric materials. Non-limiting examples of polymeric materials include polystyrene, polycarbonate, =polypropylene, polydimethysiloxanes (PDMS), polyurethane, polyvinylehloride (PVC), polysulfonc, polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS), and glass.[00209]    The device or the subcomponents of the device may be manufactured by variety of methods including, without limitation, stamping, injection molding, embossing, casting, blow molding, machining, welding, ultrasonic welding, and thermal bonding. In an embodiment, a device in manufactured by injection molding, thermal bonding, and ultrasonic welding. The subcomponents of the device can be affixed to each other by thermal bonding, ultrasonic welding, friction fitting (press fitting), adhesives or, in the case of certain substrates, for example, glass, or semi-rigid and non-rigid polymeric substrates, a natural adhesion between the two components.[00210]    A system as described can run a variety of assays, regardless of the analyte being detected from a bodily fluid sample. A protocol dependent on the identity of the device may be transferred from an external device where it can be stored to a reader assembly to enable the reader assembly to carry out the specific protocol on the device. In some embodiments, the device has an identifier (ID) that is detected or read by an identifier detector described herein. The identifier can enable two-way communication between the device and a sensor or receiving system. The identifier detector can communicate with a communication assembly via a controller which transmits the identifier to an external device. Where desired, the external device sends a protocol stored on the external device to the communication assembly based on the identifier. The protocol to be run on the system may comprise instructions to the controller of the system to perform the protocol, including but not limited to a particular assay to be nin and a detection method to be performed. Once the assay is performed by the system, a signal indicative of an analyte in the bodily fluid sample is generated and detected by a detection assembly of the system. The detected signal may then be communicated to the communications assembly, where it can be transmitted to the external device for processing, including without limitation, calculation of the analyte concentration in the sample.[00211]    Systems, devices and methods for performing sample analysis using point-of-care devices and tips that can function as reaction chambers are described in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2009/0088336 and U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/997,460.[00212]    Sample HandlinE and Reaction Chambers [002131    Samples, reagents, and assembled assays described herein can be handled and contained by a variety of reaction chamber types. A sample handing device and a reaction chamber can be a well, a tube, or an open ended tip, which may also be a cuvette. As used herein, a tip can also referred to as a sample tip, a cuvette tip, a reaction chamber, a cuvette, a capillary, a sample handing device, or a sample transfer device. Samples may be collected from a source into a tip or a tube. The tips may be sealed. Such seals may be permanent or reversible. Diluted samples can be combined with one or more reagents and mixed (as described in previous applications) within \"assay elements\" such as tips (open-ended cuvettes) or open or covered wells. Once the assay is ready for reading, the assay element can be presented to the optical system for image analysis or other types of reading. Alternatively, assay reaction mixtures can be transferred from one type of element to another. For example, assays incubated in tips can be blotted onto an absorbent or bibulous medium or assays incubated in wells can be aspirated into tips. Many assays can be processed in parallel. Assay readout can be serial or ;A 028251962013-07-18 simultaneous depending on the assay protocol and/or incubation time. For assays involving measurement of a rate of change, the assay element can be presented to the optical system more than once at different times.[00214]    Fluid and Material Transfer Devices [00215]    A fluid transfer device can be part of a system. The fluid transfer device can comprise a plurality of heads. Any number of heads as is necessary to detect a plurality of analytes in a sample is envisioned for a fluid transfer device of the invention. In an example, a fluid transfer device has about eight heads mounted in a line and separated by a distance. In an embodiment, the heads have a tapered nozzle that engages by press fitting with a variety of tips, such as assay unit or sample collection units as described herein. The tips can have a feature that enables them to be removed automatically by the instrument and disposed into in a housing of a device as described after use. In an embodiment, the assay tips are clear and transparent and can be similar to a cuvette within which an assay is run that can be detected by an optical detector such as a photomultiplier tube or camera sensor.[00216]    In an example, a programmable processor (e.g., central processing unit, CPU) of a system can comprise or be configured to accept (such as, e.g., from a memory location) instructions or commands and can operate a fluid transfer device according to the instructions to transfer liquid samples by either withdrawing (for drawing liquid in) or extending (for expelling liquid) a piston into a closed air space. The processor can be configured to facilitate aspiration and/or dispensing. Both the volume or air moved and the speed of movement can be precisely controlled, for example, by the programmable processor.[00217]    Mixing of samples (or reagents) with diluents (or other reagents) can be achieved by aspirating components to be mixed into a common tube and then repeatedly aspirating a significant fraction of the combined liquid volume up and down into a tip. Dissolution of reagents dried into a tube can be done is similar fashion. Incubation of liquid samples and reagents with a capture surface on which is bound a capture reagent (for example an antibody) can be achieved by drawing the appropriate liquid into the tip and holding it there for a predetermined time. Removal of samples and reagents can be achieved by expelling the liquid into a reservoir or an absorbent pad in a device as described. Another reagent can then be drawn into the tip according to instructions or protocol from the programmable processor.[00218]    A system can comprise a holder or engager for moving the assay units or tips. An engager may comprise a vacuum assembly or an assembly designed to fit snugly into a boss of an assay unit tip. For example, a means for moving the tips can be moved in a manner similar to the fluid transfer device heads. The device can also be moved on a stage according to the position of an engager or holder.[00219]    In an embodiment, an instrument for moving the tips is the same as an instrument for moving a volume of sample, such as a fluid transfer device as described herein. For example, a sample collection tip can be fit onto a pipette head according to the boss on the collection tip. The collection tip can then be used to distribute the liquid throughout the device and system. After the liquid has been distributed, the collection tip can be disposed, and the pipette head can be fit onto an assay unit according to the boss on the assay unit. The assay unit tip can then be moved from reagent unit to reagent unit, and reagents can be distributed to the assay unit according to the aspiration- or pipette-type action provided by the pipette head. The pipette head can also perform mixing within a collection tip, assay unit, or reagent unit by aspiration- or syringe-type action.[00220]    In another embodiment, tips containing liquids including assay reaction mixtures can be disconnected from the pipetting device and \"parked\" at specific locations within the instrument or within a ;A 028251962013.07-18 disposable unit. If needed, tips can be capped using a seal (as used in the centrifuge) to prevent liquids from draining out. In some embodiments, the seal can be a vinyl seal.[00221]    Exemplary Sample Tips [00222]    A variety of container shapes can be utilized as sample tips, reaction chambers, and cuvettes. For example, a cuvette can be circular, cylindrical, square, rectangular, cubical, conical, pyramidal, or any other shape capable of holding a sample of fluid. Rectangular cuvettes where a light beam impinges at right angles to the cuvette surfaces as shown in plan and section views in Figure 63 can be employed. In such rectangular cuvettes, the liquid sample that is illuminated is also rectangular and is defined by the cuvette. Cuvettes with circular cross-sections can also be used. For example, some types of microliter plates where the illuminated sample volume is in part defined by the sample meniscus as shown below in plan and section view in Figure 64.[00223]    Variable pathlength cuvettes can be used to optimize and extend the assay response and minimize the volume of sample required to measure the assay. Cuvettes can be longer in relation to their cross-section in at least one region. In some cases, the pathlength of a cuvette can be selected based on cuvette geometry and/or material. Different cuvettes can be selected for different assays.[00224]    In the present invention, one preferred version of the assay cuvette has a circular cross-section in the direction of the light beam as shown in Figure 65. The use of a cuvette with a circular cross-section has several advantages, including, but not limited to the following:[00225]    1. The optical pathlength can be precisely defined. Dimensional precision of injection-molded parts have been found to be better than 1-2 % CV. In conventional microtiter plates the unconstrained liquid meniscus can introduce imprecision in pathlength.[00226]    2. The open-ended character and circular section of the tips confers excellent fluid handling characteristics, making aspiration of liquids very precise.[00227]    3. The optical image of the tips provides for the ability to identify the tip location and boundaries of the liquid column and to locate very precisely the center of the tip where the signal is maximal.[00228]    4. More than one liquid sample can be incubated and analyzed in the same tip. This is because in the narrow part of the tip, very little material transfer occurs (in the axial direction) between adjacent \"slugs\" of liquid.[00229]    An exemplary tip may have the following general features:[00230]    Tip length: 0.5 ¨ 4 cm [00231]    Tip OD: 0.2 ¨ 1.0 cm [00232]    Tip ID: 0.1 ¨ 0.5 cm [00233]    Tip capacity for liquids: 5 ¨ 50 uL[00234]    Tip dimensional precision: generally better than 2% or +7- 0.001 cm [00235]    Tip configuration: The tip will generally have a feature that engages with a pipette (cylindrical) so as to form a fluid tight seal. There is a region generally cylindrical or conical which is used for imaging. Generally the optical part of the tip will have at least two different sections with different pathleingths. The lower end of the tip will typically be narrow so as to aid in retention of vertical liquid columns under gravity [00236]    Tip material: Clear or uniformly specular plastic (polystyrene, polypropylene etc.) (transmission of light in the visible > 80%) ;A 028251962013-07-18 [00237]    For imaging purposes, the tip can generally be clear or translucent, but the tips do not have to be clear to work well as assay cuvettes when three-color analysis is used. Tip cuvettes which appear \"cloudy\" may function similarly to clear tips. The cloudy tips are made in injection molds with non-polished or textured surfaces or by adding some light scattering material to the plastic used to fabricate the tips. The light scattering intensity of such cloudy tips may be chosen to be not so great as to obscure the colored liquid to be measured. In general, the impact of light scattering on transmitted light can be selected to be less than 10, (20, and 30 %) relative to the impact of the colored material. The light scattering effect can be selected such that the light scattering of the cloudy tips is uniform.[00238]    The tips and reaction chambers described herein can be comprised of a cylindrical (or conical) shaft about 2 cm in length and having an inner diameter of about 1-5 mm corresponding to a capacity of about ¨ 50 uL.[00239]    In one example, at the upper end of the cylinder is a truncated cylindrical \"boss\" fluidically connected to the cylinder and adapted so as to be able to engage with the tapered feature of a pipetter. The lower end of the tip may be narrowed to provide a feature that enables the tip to hold its liquid contents when oriented vertically and not attached to the pipetter. The tip may be a pointed tip. The external shape of the lower end of the tip is typically also somewhat pointed with the diameter being reduced from the main part of the cylindrical shaft toward the end so as to be capable or being fluidically sealed with a flexible (vinyl) cap into which the tip end is press fit. Tips are usually made of molded plastic (polystyrene, polypropylene and the like). The tips can be clear or translucent such that information about the sample can be acquired by imaging.[00240]    Figure 4, Figure 5, and Figure 6 show an example of a tip. The tip is configured with (1) an upper feature that can engage to form an air tight seal with a pipette head, (2) a basically cylindrical (actually conical with a very slight draft angle) shaft and a narrow, pointed lower tip. This tip can form a liquid-tight seal with a cap. The pointed shape aids in getting good conformance with the cap under moderate force. The material used is injection-molded polystyrene. The overall dimensions are: 32 mm long, about 7.6 mm largest outer diameter, useful capacity about 20 uL. The dimensions of the tip can be scaled to a larger volume. For example, for a 50 uL sample, the IDs can be increased by about 1.6-fold.[00241]    Scaling can be achieved using a cap made of vinyl or other materials which is easily press-fit to the narrow end of the sample containment means using force generated by motion of the instrument stage in the z-direction. A bubble of air can become trapped within the tip when the tip is capped. A centrifugation step can be used to drive the bubble to the top of the column of blood so as to eliminate the effects of the bubble. The dimensions of the tip and/or the dimensions of the tip holder in a centrifuge can be matched such that a tip can be secured for centrifugation.[00242]    Sample Preparation [00243]    The invention provides for systems, methods, and devices for the processing and analysis of samples can be collected from a variety of sources. For example, the sample can be collected from patients, animals, or the environment. The sample can be a bodily fluid. Any bodily fluids suspected to contain an analyte of interest can be used in conjunction with the system or devices of the invention. Commonly employed bodily fluids include but are not limited to blood, serum, saliva, urine, gastric and digestive fluid, tears, stool, semen, vaginal fluid, interstitial fluids derived from tumorous tissue, and cerebrospinal fluid.   ;A 028251962013-07-18 [00244]    In some embodiments, the bodily fluid is a blood sample from a human patient. The blood source can be collected from a finger prick and have a volume of less than about 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, or 1000 uL.[00245]    A bodily fluid may be drawn from a patient and provided to a device in a variety of ways, including but not limited to, lancing, injection, or pipetting.[00246]    As used herein, the terms \"subject\" and \"patient\" are used interchangeably herein, and refer to a vertebrate, preferably a mammal, more preferably a human. Mammals include, but are not limited to, murines, simians, humans, farm animals, sport animals, and pets.[00247]    In one embodiment, a lancet punctures the skin and withdraws a sample using, for example, gravity, capillary action, aspiration, or vacuum force. The lancet may be part of the device, or part of a system or a stand-alone component. Where needed, the lancet may be activated by a variety of mechanical, electrical, electromechanical, or any other known activation mechanism or any combination of such methods. In another embodiment where no active mechanism is required, a patient can simply provide a bodily fluid to the device, as for example, could occur with a saliva sample. The collected fluid can be placed in the sample collection unit within the device. In yet another embodiment, the device comprises at least one microneedle which punctures the skin.[00248]    The volume of bodily fluid to be used with a device can be less than about 500 microliters, typically between about 1 to 100 microliters. Where desired, a sample of 1 to 50 microliters, 1 to 40 microliters, 1 to 30 microliters, 1 to 10 microliters or even 1 to 3 microliters can be used for detecting an analyte using the device. In an embodiment, the volume of bodily fluid used for detecting an analyte utilizing the subject devices or systems is one drop of fluid. For example, one drop of blood from a pricked finger can provide the sample of bodily fluid to be analyzed with a device, system or method described herein.[00249]    A sample of bodily fluid can be collected from a subject directly into a tip of the described herein, or can be later transferred to a tip.[00250]    Sample Dilution [00251]    In some instances, the configuration of the processor to direct fluid transfer effects a degree of dilution of the bodily fluid sample in the array of assay units to bring signals indicative of the plurality of analytes being detected within a detectable range, such that said plurality of analytes are detectable with said system. In an example, the bodily fluid sample comprises at least two analytes that are present at concentrations that differ by at least 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 50, 100, 500, 1000, 10,000, 10, 106, 107, 108, 109, or 1016 fold. In an example the bodily fluid sample is a single drop of blood. In an embodiment, the concentrations of at least two analytes present in a sample differs by up to 10 orders of magnitude (for example, a first analyte is present at 0.1 pg/mL and a second analyte is present at 500 ug/mL). In another example, some protein analytes are found at concentrations of greater than 100 ing/mL, which can extend the range of interest to about twelve orders of magnitude. In the case of measurement of nucleic acid analytes such as DNA and RNA using exponential amplification methods such as polymerase reaction, the number of copies of analyte can be increased by a billion fold prior to measurement.[00252]    Where desired, a degree of dilution of the bodily fluid sample can bring the signals indicative of the at least two analytes within the detectable range.   ;A 028251962013-07-18 [00253]    As described, the systems and devices herein can enable many features of the flexibility of laboratory setting in a POC environment. For example, samples can be collected and manipulated automatically in a table top size or smaller device or system. A common issue in POC devices is achieving different dilution ranges when conducting a plurality of assays, wherein the assays may have significantly different sensitivity or specificity. For example, there may be two analytes in a sample, but one analyte has a high concentration in the sample and the other analyte has a very low concentration. As provided, the systems and devices herein can dilute the sample to significantly different levels in order to detect both analytes. Alternatively, a sample may be split into two or more samples, which may enable individual analytes to be detected at various levels of dilution.[00254]    For example, if the analyte is in a high concentration, a sample can be serially diluted to the appropriate detection range and provided to a capture surface for detection. In the same system or device, a sample with an analyte in a low concentration may not need to be diluted. In this manner, the assay range of the POC devices and systems provided herein can be expanded from many of the current POC devices.[00255]    In POC assay systems using disposable cartridges containing the diluent there is often a practical limit to the extent of dilution. For example, if a small blood sample is obtained by fingerstick (for example, about 20 microliters) is to be diluted and the maximum volume of diluent that can be placed in a tube is 250 microliters, the practical limit or dikition or the whole sample is about 10-fold. Iii an example herein, a system can aspirate a smaller volume of the sample (for example about 2 microliters) making the maximum dilution factor about 100-fold. For many assays, such dilution factors are acceptable but for an assay like that of CRP (as described in the examples herein) there is a need to dilute the sample much more. Separation-based ELISA assays can have an intrinsic limitation in the capacity of the capture surface to bind the analyte (for example about a few hundred ng/ml for a typical protein analyte). Some analytes are present in blood at hundreds of micrograms/ml. Even when diluted by 100-fold, the analyte concentration may be outside the range of calibration. In an exemplary embodiment of a system, device, and fluid transfer device herein, multiple dilutions can be achieved by performing multiple fluid transfers of the diluent into an individual assay unit or sample collection unit. For example, if the concentration of an analyte is very high in a sample as described above, the sample can be diluted multiple times until the concentration of the analyte is within an acceptable detection range. The systems and methods herein can provide accurate measurements or estimations of the dilutions in order to calculate the original concentration of the analytc.[00256]    Sample Separation [00257]    In some embodiments of the invention, a sample can be prepared for analysis by an initial separation step. For example, if the assay is to analyze DNA, a DNA separation step can be employed to eliminate or reduce contaminants or unwanted source material. The separation step can utilize chromatography, centrifugation, liquid-liquid extraction, solid-liquid extraction, affinity binding, or any other mechanisms known to one skilled in the art.[00258]    In some embodiments, a blood sample to be analyzed is first processed by separating the plasma component from the blood sample. This step can be performed using a variety of techniques, such as filtration, centrifugation, and affinity binding. Centrifugation can be an efficient method for separation of blood sample components, and can be employed in the present invention.[00259]    Plasma separation -;A 028251962013-07-18 [00260]    Blood can be introduced into a close ended or sealable tip in a variety of ways, for example samples can be provided in a tube and a sealable tip can receive the sample from the tube via capillary action or via pneumatic force. One preferred means of introduction is the use of capillary action. Alternatively, container used to hold the sample for centrifugal separation can be configured with only one opening as in a conventional centrifuge.[00261]    The tip, once filled with blood, can be moved automatically to a location in a disposable cartridge where there is a sealing element. The sealing element can be a small \"cup\" made of a deformable (pliant) material (vinyl, silicone or the like) conformed to fit on the lower end of the tip and to seal it. The tip is pressed into the seal by the instrument thus forming a liquid-tight junction. The sealed tip is then moved to a small centrifuge (typically located in and forming part of the instrument) and press-fit into a positioning feature in the centrifuge rotor such that the lower (sealed) end of the tip butts up to a rigid shelf that will support the tip during the centrifugation step.[00262]    The centrifuge rotor can be circular having about 10 cm in diameter. The mass of the blood-containing tip is either (1) small relative to the rotor or (2), where desired, balanced by a counter weight located on the opposite part of the rotor such that any vibration during the centrifugation step is minimized. One exemplary orientation of the centrifuge rotor is vertical (axis of rotation horizontal). The rotor is mounted in a drive shaft with is driven by an electric motor.[00263]    Centrifugation can be achieved by spinning the rotor at about 15,000 rpm for 5 minutes. During this process, the particular elements in the blood (red cells and white cells) sediment to the scaled end of the tip and form a closely packed column with cell free plasma separated at the part of the tip distal from the seal.[00264]    The tip containing the separated sample can then be placed vertically in a location accessible to a fluid handling device comprised of a narrow pipette tip (\"sample acquisition tip\") mounted on a pipetting device in turn mounted on an x-y-z stage.[00265]    Plasma can now be efficiently recovered from the centrifuged sample. This is achieved by moving the sample acquisition tip vertically along the axis of the centrifuge tip so that it comes into fluid contact with the plasma and can draw the plasma upwards using, e.g., pneumatic means.[00266]    Optionally, this operation can be monitored using a camera or other imaging device which can be used both to measure the sample hematocrit and to provide information as to the location of the plasma/red cell boundary to the stage/pipetter controller. With the aid of imaging the separated blood, a narrow pipette tip fitted to a pipette is slowly moved vertically down, such that the tip is directed axially down the sample containment means until it contacts the plasma. The tip is then moved further until it is close (within less than about 3, 2, 1, 0.5, or 0.1 mm) of the packed cell interface. At the same time, plasma is aspirated into the narrow pipette tip under computer control. The plasma can be aspirated simultaneously while moving the narrow pipette tip into the plasma column so that the plasma does not become displaced into the upper part of the sample containment means. The aspiration can be controlled to avoid air being aspirated during the plasma removal step.[00267]    In general, a pipette tip with a very narrow end, such as those used to apply samples to an electrophoresis system, can be used to aspirate the plasma from the centrifuged sample tip. The narrow tip is typically conical or tapered and has dimensions 1 ¨ 3 x 0.1 ¨ 0.5 cm (length x diameter) and made of any of a variety of materials (polypropylene, polystyrene etc.). The material can be clear or translucent in the visible. One end of the tip engages with a pipetting device. The other is very narrow (0.05 ¨0.5 mm OD) such that it ;A 028251962013-07-18 can move into the sample tip without touching thc inner surface of the sample tip. Even if there is contact between the plasma aspiration tip and the sample tip, plasma aspiration is not hindered.[00268]    A schematic of the plasma aspiration process at the stage where the plasma aspiration tip is located just above the plasma-packed cell interface during the aspiration step is shown in Figure 7.[00269]    In this way we have found that almost all of the plasma can be removed leaving as little as e.g. 1 uL in the centrifuged sample tip. This corresponds to about 11 uL of plasma (90% recovery) from 20 uL of blood with a 40% hematocrit. Additionally the quality of the plasma sample (with respect to hemolysis, lipemia and icteria) can be determined from an image of the centrifuged sample.[00270]    The aspirated plasma can be moved to other locations for dilution and mixing with assay reagents so that assays for analytes industry but not limited to metabolites, electrolytes, protein biomarkers, drugs and nucleic acids may be performed.[00271]    Separation of white blood cells [00272]    A further use of the invention is to isolate and concentrate the white cells from blood. In one aspect of the invention, the blood sample is first subject to a process which lyses the red cells (and optionally Fixes the white cells) by adding a reagent (For example, RD PharmlyseTm 555899 or RD FACSTM Lysing Solution 349202) to the blood and mixing. Following a brief incubation, the lysed sample is subject to centrifugation as described above such that the white cells are concentrated at the sealed end of the blood tip. The lyscd red cell solution can then be removed by aspiration. Recovery of the white cells is achieved by either (1) addition of a small amount of a buffer solution and repeated up and down aspiration to re-suspend the cells followed by displacement into a receptacle or (2) removal of the seal and downward displacement of the packed cells into a receptacle using air pressure.[00273]    An alternate scheme allows recovery of white cells without lysis of the red cells. After centrifugation of blood (as is well known) the white cells form a layer on top of the packed red cells known as the Buffy Coat. Following removal of most of the plasma (as above) the white cells can be efficiently recovered by (1) optionally adding a small volume (e.g. about 5 uL) of isotonic buffer, or (2) using the residual plasma and re-suspending the white cells by repeated aspiration and/or mechanical stirring using the sample acquisition tip. Once suspended, the resulting mixture of white cells together with a small proportion of red cells also re-suspended can be acquired by aspiration for analysis of the white cells. In this way most of the white cells (typically all) can be recovered with only a small (contaminating) quantity of red cells (typically less than 5% of the original).[00274]    Centrifitges [00275]    Figure 1, Figure 2, and Figure 3 show scale perspectives of a centrifuge (Figure 1 - side view, Figure 2 - front face view, Figure 3 - rear view) that can be integrated into the system. The centrifuge may contain an electric motor capable of turning the rotor at 15,000 rpm. One type of centrifuge rotor is shaped somewhat like a fan blade is mounted on the motor spindle in a vertical plane. Affixed to the rotor is an element which holds the sample holding means (tip) and provides a ledge or shelf on which the end of the tip distal to the motor axis rests and which provides support during the centrifugation so that the sample cannot escape. The tip may be further supported at its proximal end by a mechanical stop in the rotor. This can be provided so that the force generated during centrifugation does not cause the tip to cut through the soft vinyl cap. The tip can be inserted and removed by standard pick and place mechanisms but preferably by a pipette. The rotor is a single ;A 028251962013-07-18 piece of acrylic (or other material) shaped to minimize vibration and noise during operation of the centrifuge. The rotor is (optionally) shaped so that when it is oriented in particular angles to the vertical, other movable components in the instrument can move past the centrifuge. The sample holding means are centrifugally balanced by counter masses on the opposite side of the rotor such that the center of rotational inertia is axial relative to the motor. The centrifuge motor may provide positional data to a computer which can then control the rest position of the rotor (typically vertical before and after centrifugation).[00276]    As may be seen from the two graphs in Figure 8 and Figure 9, to minimize centrifugation time (without generating too much mechanical stress during centrifugation) according to published standards (DIN 58933-1; for the U.S. the CLSI standard I107-A3 \"Procedure for Determining Packed Cell Volume by the Microheinatocrit Method\"; Approved Standard - Third Edition) convenient dimensions for the rotor are in the range of about 5 ¨ 10 cm spinning at aboutl 0 - 20 thousand rpm giving a time to pack the red cells of about 5 min.[00277]    An exemplary equation for calculating centrifugation force is shown below: [00278]r ( 2 TiN 12 CT 13 .      ¨  _______ [00279][00280]    Where:[00281]    gis earth's gravitational acceleration, [00282]    Tis the rotational radius, [00283]    Nis the rotational speed, measured in revolutions per unit of time.[00284]    Where:[00285]    .rcniis the rotational radius measured in centimeters (cm), [00286]    RP,Mis rotational speed measured in revolutions per minute (RPM).[00287] REIF = 1 .1    x         Af.RPM[00288]    In some embodiments, a centrifuge may be a horizontally oriented centrifuge with a swinging bucket design. In some preferable embodiments, the axis of rotation of the centrifuge is vertical. In alternate embodiments, the axis of rotation can be horizontal or at any angle. The centrifuge may be capable of simultaneously spinning two or more vessels and may be designed to be fully integrated into an automated system employing computer-controlled pipettes. In some embodiments, the vessels may be close-bottomed. The swinging bucket design may permit the centrifugation vessels to be passively oriented in a vertical position when stopped, and spin out to a fixed angle when spinning. In some embodiments, the swinging buckets may permit the centrifugation vessels to spin out to a horizontal orientation. Alternatively they may spin out to any angle between a vertical and horizontal position (e.g., about 15, 30, 45, 60, or 75 degrees from vertical. The centrifuge with swinging bucket design may meet the positional accuracy and repeatability requirements of a robotic system a number of positioning systems are employed.[00289]    A computer-based control system may use position information from an optical encoder in order to spin the rotor at controlled slow speeds. Because an appropriate motor could be designed for high-speed performance, accurate static positions need not be held using position feedback alone. In some embodiments, a cam in combination with a solenoid-actuated lever may be employed to achieve very accurate and stable ;A 028251962013.07-18 stopping at a fixed number of positions. Using a separate control system and feedback from Hall-Effect sensors built into the motor, the velocity of the rotor can be very accurately controlled at high speeds.[00290]    Because a number of sensitive instruments must function simultaneously within the assay instrument system, the design of the centrifuge preferably minimizes or reduces vibration. The rotor may be aerodynamically designed with a smooth exterior ¨ fully enclosing the buckets when they are in their horizontal position. Also, vibration dampening can be employed in multiple locations in the design of the ease.Rotor [00291]    A centrifuge rotor can be a component of the system which may hold and spin the centrifugation vessel(s). The axis of rotation can be vertical, and thus the rotor itself can be positioned horizontally. However, in alternate embodiments, different axes of rotation and rotor positions can be employed. There are two components known as buckets positioned symmetrically on either side of the rotor which hold the centrifugation vessels. Alternative configurations are possible in which buckets are oriented with radial symmetry, for example three buckets oriented at 120 degrees. Any number of buckets may be provided, including but not limited to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or more buckets. The buckets can be evenly spaced from one another. For example, if n buckets are provided where n is a whole number, then the buckets may be spaced about 360/n degrees apart from one another. In other embodiments, the buckets need not be spaced evenly around one another or with radial symmetry.[00292]    When the rotor is stationary, these buckets, influenced by gravity, may passively fall such as to position the vessels vertically and to make them accessible to the pipette. Figure 111 shows an example of a rotor at rest with buckets vertical. In some embodiments, the buckets may passively fall to a predetermined angle that may or may not be vertical. When the rotor spins, the buckets are forced into a nearly horizontal position or to a predetermined angle by centrifugal forces. Figure 112 shows an example of a rotor at a speed with buckets at a small angle to horizontal. There can be physical hard stops for both the vertical and horizontal positions acting to enforce their accuracy and positional repeatability.[00293]    The rotor may be aerodynamically designed with a disk shape, and as few physical features as possible in order to minimize vibration caused by air turbulence. To achieve this, the outer geometry of the bucket may exactly match that of the rotor such that when the rotor is spinning and the bucket can be forced horizontal the bucket and rotor can be perfectly aligned.[00294]    To facilitate plasma extraction, the rotor may be angled down toward the ground relative to the horizon. Because the angle of the bucket can be matched to that of the rotor, this may enforce a fixed spinning angle for the bucket. The resulting pellet from such a configuration could be angled relative to the vessel when placed upright. A narrow extraction tip may be used to aspirate plasma from the top of the centrifugation vessel. By placing the extraction tip near the bottom of the slope created by the angle pellet, the final volume of plasma can be more efficiently extracted without disturbing the sensitive buffy coat.[00295]    A variety of tubes designs can be accommodated in the buckets of the device. In some embodiments, the various tube designs may be closed ended. Some are shaped like conventional centrifuge tubes with conical bottoms. Other tube designs may be cylindrical. Tubes with a low ratio of height to cross-sectional area may be favored for cell processing. Tubes with a large ratio (>10:1) may be suitable for accurate measurement of hematocrit and other imaging requirements. However, any height to cross-sectional area ratio may be employed. The buckets can be made of any of several plastics (polystyrene, polypropylene), or any ;A 028251962013-07-18 othcr material discussed elsewhere herein. Buckets have capacities ranging from a few microliters to about a milliliter. The tubes may be inserted into and removed from the centrifuge using a \"pick and place\" mechanism. Control System [00296]    Due to the spinning and positioning requirements of the centrifuge device, a dual control system approach may be used. To index the rotor to specific rotational orientations, a position based control system may be implemented. In some embodiments, the control system may employ a PID (Proportional Integral Derivative) control system. Other feedback control systems known in the art can be employed. Positional feedback for the position controller may be provided by a high-resolution optical encoder. For operating the centrifuge at low to high speeds, a velocity controller may be implemented, while employing a PID control system tuned for velocity control. Rotational rate feedback for the velocity controller may be provided by a set of simple Hall-Effect sensors placed on the motor shaft. Each sensor may generate a square wave at one cycle per motor shaft rotation.Stopping Mechanism [00297]    To consistently and firmly position the rotor in a particular position, a physical stopping mechanism may be employed. In one embodiment, the stopping mechanism may use a cam, coupled to the rotor, along with a solenoid-actuated lever. The cam may be shaped like a circular disk with a number of \"C\" shaped notches machined around the perimeter. To position the centrifuge rotor, its rotational velocity may first be lowered to, at most, 30RPM. In other embodiments, the rotational velocity may be lowered to any other amount, including but not limited to about 5 rpm, 10 rpm, 15 rpm, 20 rpm, 25 rpm, 35 rpm, 40 rpm, or 50 rpm. Once the speed is sufficiently stow, the lever may be actuated. At the end of the lever is a cam follower which may glide along the perimeter of the cam with minimal friction. Once the cam follower reaches the center of a particular notch in the cam, the force of the solenoid-actuated lever can overcome that of the motor and the rotor may be brought to a halt. At that point the motor may be electronically braked, and, in combination with the stopping mechanism a rotational position can be very accurately and firmly held indefinitely.Centrifuge buckets [00298]    The centrifuge swing-out buckets may be configured to accommodate different type of centrifuge tubes. In preferable embodiments, the various tube types may have a collar or flange at their upper (open) end. This collar or flange feature may rests on the upper end of the bucket and support the tube during centrifugation. As shown in Figures 113, 114, and 115, conical and cylindrical tubes of various lengths and volumes can be accommodated. Figures 113, 114, and 115 provide examples of buckets and other bucket designs may be employed. For example, Figure 113, shows an example of a bucket configuration. The bucket may have side portions that mate with the centrifuge and allow the bucket to swing freely. The bucket may have a closed bottom and an opening at the top. Figure 114 shows an example of a centrifugation vessel mated with the bucket. As previously mentioned, the bucket may be shaped to accept various configurations of centrifugation vessels. The centrifugation vessel may have one or more protruding member that may rest upon the bucket. The centrifugation vessel may be shaped with one or more feature that may mate with the centrifugation bucket. The feature may be a shaped feature of the vessel or one or more protrusion. Figure 115 shows an example of another centrifugation vessel that can be mated with the bucket. As previously described, the bucket can have one or more shaped feature that may allow different configurations of centrifugation vessels to mate with the bucket.   ;A 028251962013-07-18 Centrifuge tubes and sample extraction means:[00299]    The centrifuge tube and extraction tip may be provided individually and can be mated together for extraction of material following centrifugation. The centrifugation tube and extraction tip may be designed to deal with complex processes in an automated system. Figure 116 shows an example of a centrifugation vessel. Figure 117 shows an example of an extraction tip. Figure 118 provides an example of how the centrifugation vessel and extraction tip may mate. Any dimensions are provided by way of example only, and other dimensions of the same or differing proportions may be utilized.[00300]    The system can enable one or more of the following:1.    Rapid processing of small blood samples (typically 5 ¨ 50 uL) 2.    Accurate and precise measurement of hematocrit 3.    Efficient removal of plasma 4.    Efficient re-suspension of formed elements (red and white blood cells) 5.    Concentration of white cells (following labeling with fluorescent antibodies and fixation plus lysis of red cells) 6.    Optical confirmation of red cell lysis and recovery of white cells Centrifugation Vessel and Extraction Tip Overview [00301]    A custom vessel and tip may be used for the operation of the centrifuge in order to satisfy the variety of constraints placed on the system. The centrifugation vessel may be a closed bottom tube designed to be spun in the centrifuge. In some embodiments, the centrifugation vessel may be the vessel illustrated in Figure 116 or may have one or more features illustrated in Figure 116. It may have a number of unique features enabling the wide range of required functionality including hematocrit measurement, RBC lysing, pellet re-suspension and efficient plasma extraction. The extraction tip may be designed to be inserted into the centrifugation vessel for precise fluid extraction, and pellet re-suspension. In some embodiments, the extraction tip may be the tip illustrated in Figure 117 or may have one or more features illustrated in Figure 117. Exemplary specifications for each tip are discussed herein.Centrifugation Vessel [00302]    The centrifugation vessel may be designed to handle two separate usage scenarios, each associated with a different anti-coagulant and whole blood volume.[00303]    A first usage scenario may require that 40uL of whole blood with Heparin be pelleted, the maximum volume of plasma be recovered, and the hematocrit measured using computer vision. In the case of 60% hematocrit or below the volume of plasma required or preferable may be about 40uL*40%=16uL.[00304]    In some embodiments, it will not be possible to recover 100% of the plasma because the huffy coat must not be disturbed, thus a minimum distance must be maintained between the bottom of the tip and the top of the pellet. This minimum distance can be determined experimentally but the volume (V) sacrificed as a function of the required safety distance (d) can be estimated using: V(d) = d*R1.25mm2. For example, for a required safety distance of 0.25 mm, the sacrificed volume could be 1.23uL for the 60% hematocrit case. This volume can be decreased by decreasing the internal radius of the hematocrit portion of the centrifugation vessel. However, because in some embodiments, that narrow portion must fully accommodate the outer radius of the extraction tip which can be no smaller than 1.5 mm, the existing dimensions of the centrifugation vessel may be close to the minimum.   ;A 028251962013-07-18 [00305]    Along with plasma extraction, in some embodiments it may also be required that the hematocrit be measured using computer vision. In order to facilitate this process the total height for a given volume of hematocrit may be maximized by minimizing the internal diameter of the narrow portion of the vessel. By maximizing the height, the relationship between changes in hcmatocrit volume and physical change in column height may be optimized, thus increasing the number of pixels that can be used for the measurement. The height of the narrow portion of the vessel may also be long enough to accommodate the worst-case scenario of 80% hematocrit while still leaving a small portion of plasma at the top of the column to allow for efficient extraction. Thus, 40uL*80% = 32uL may be the required volume capacity for accurate measurement of the hematocrit. The volume of the narrow portion of the tip as designed may be about 35.3uL which may allow for some volume of plasma to remain, even in the worst case.[00306]    A second usage scenario is much more involved, and may require one, more, or all of the following:=    whole blood pelleted =    plasma extracted =    pellet re-suspended in lysing buffer and stain =    remaining white blood cells (WBCs) pelleted =    supernatant removed =    WBCs re-suspended =    WBC suspension Ally extracted [00307]    In order to fully re-suspend a packed pellet, experiments have shown one can physically disturb the pellet with a tip capable of completely reaching the bottom of the vessel containing the pellet. A preferable geometry of the bottom of the vessel using for re-suspension seems to be a hemispherical shape similar to standard commercial PCR tubes. In other embodiments, other vessel bottom shapes may be used. The centrifugation vessel, along with the extraction tip, may be designed to facilitate the re-suspension process by adhering to these geometrical requirements while also allowing the extraction tip to physically contact the bottom.[00308]    During manual re-suspension experiments it was noticed that physical contact between the bottom of the vessel, and the bottom of the tip may create a seal that prohibits fluid movement. A delicate spacing may be used in order to both fully disturb the pellet, while allowing fluid flow. In order to facilitate this process in a robotic system, a physical feature may be added to the bottom of the centrifugation vessel. In some embodiments, this feature may comprise four small hemispherical nubs placed around the perimeter of the bottom portion of the vessel. When the extraction tip is fully inserted into the vessel and allowed to make physical contact, the end of the tip may rest on the nubs, and fluid is allowed to freely flow between the nubs. This may result in a small amount of volume (¨.25uL) lost in the gaps.[00309]    During the lysing process, in some implementations, the maximum expected fluid volume is 60uL, which, along with 25uL displaced by the extraction tip may demand a total volume capacity of 85uL. A design with a current maximum volume of 100uL may exceed this requirement. Other aspects of the second usage scenario require similar or already discussed tip characteristics.[00310]    The upper geometry of the centrifugation vessel may be designed to mate with a pipette nozzle. Any pipette nozzle described elsewhere herein or known in the art may be used. The external geometry of the upper portion of the vessel may exactly match that of a reaction tip which both the current nozzle and cartridge may be designed around. In some embodiments, a small ridge may circumscribe the internal surface of the upper portion. This ridge may be a visual marker of the maximum fluid height, meant to facilitate automatic error detection using computer vision system.[00311]    In some embodiments, the distance from the bottom of the fully mated nozzle to the top of the maximum fluid line is 2.5mm. This distance is 1.5mm less than the 4mm recommended distance adhered to by the extraction tip. This decreased distance may be driven by the need to minimize the length of the extraction tip while adhering to minimum volume requirements. The justification for this decreased distance stems from the particular use of the vessel. Because, in some implementations, fluid may be exchanged with the vessel from the top only, the maximum fluid it will ever have while mated with the nozzle is the maximum amount of whole blood expected at any given time (40uL). The height of this fluid may be well below the bottom of the nozzle. Another concern is that at other times the volume of fluid in the vessel may be much greater than this and wet the walls of up to the height of the nozzle. In some embodiments, it will be up to those using the vessel to ensure that the meniscus of any fluids contained within the vessel do not exceed the max fluid height, even if the total volume is less than the maximum specified. In other embodiments, other features may be provided to keep the fluid contained within the vessel.[00312]    Any dimensions, sizes, volumes, or distances provided herein are provided by way of example only. Any other dimension, size, volume or distance may be utilized which may or may not be proportional to the amounts mentioned herein.[00313]    The centrifugation vessel can be subjected to a number of forces during the process of exchanging fluids and rapidly inserting and removing tips. If the vessel is not constrained, it is possible that these forces will be strong enough to lift or otherwise dislodge the vessel from the centrifuge bucket. In order to prevent movement, the vessel should be secured in some way. To accomplish this, a small ring circumscribing the bottom exterior of the vessel was added. This ring can easily be mated with a compliant mechanical feature on the bucket. As long as the retaining force of the nub is greater than the forces experienced during fluid manipulations, but less than the friction force when mated with the nozzle then the problem is solved.Extraction Tip [00314]    The Extraction Tip may be designed to interface with the centrifugation vessel, efficiently extracting plasma, and re-suspending pelleted cells. Where desired, its total length (e.g., 34.5 mm) may exactly match that of another blood tip including but not limited to those described in US. Serial No. 12/244,723 but may be long enough to physically touch the bottom of the centrifugation vessel. The ability to touch the bottom of the vessel may be required in some embodiments, both for the re-suspension process, and for complete recovery of the white cell suspension.[00315]    The required volume of the extraction tip may be determined by the maximum volume it is expected to aspirate from the centrifugation vessel at any given time. In some embodiments, this volume may be approximately 60uL, which may be less than the maximum capacity of the tip which is 85uL. In some embodiments, a tip of greater volume than required volume may be provided. As with the centrifugation vessel, an internal feature circumscribing the interior of the upper portion of the tip may be used to mark the height of this maximum volume. The distance between the maximum volume line and the top of the mated nozzle may bc 4.5mm, which may bc considered a safc distance to prevent nozzle contamination. Any sufficient distance to prevent nozzle contamination may be used.1003161    The centrifuge may be used to sediment precipitated LDL-cholesterol. Imaging may be used to verify that the supernatant is clear, indicating complete removal of the precipitate.[00317]    In one example, plasma may be diluted (e.g., 1:10) into a mixture of dextran sulfate (25mg/dL) and magnesium sulfate (100mM), and may be then incubated for 1 minute to precipitate LDL-cholesterol. The reaction product may be aspirated into the tube of the centrifuge, capped then and spun at 3000 rpm for three minutes. Figures 119, 120, and 121 are images that were taken of the original reaction mixture prior to centrifugation (showing the white precipitate), following centrifugation (showing a clear supernatant) and of the LDL-cholesterol pellet (after removal of the cap), respectively.1003181    Other examples of centrifuges that can be employed in the present invention are described in U.S.Patent Nos, 5,693,233, 5,578,269, 6,599,476 and U.S. Patent Publication Nos. 2004/0230400, 2009/0305392, and 2010/0047790.[00319]    Example protocols 1003201    Many variations of protocol may be used for centrifugation and processing. For example, a typical protocol for use of the centrifuge to process and concentrate white cells for cytometry may include one or more of the following steps. The steps below may be provided in varying orders or other steps may be substituted for any of the steps below:1. Receive 10 uL blood anti-coagulated with EDTA (pipette injects the blood into the bottom of the centrifuge bucket) 2. Sediment the red and white cells by centrifugation (< 5 min x 10,000 g).3. Measure hematocrit by imaging 4. Remove plasma slowly by aspiration into the pipette (4 uL corresponding to the worst case scenario [60 % hematocrit]) without disturbing the cell pellet.5.    Re-suspend the pellet after adding 20 uL of an appropriate cocktail of up to five fluorescently labeled antibodies' dissolved in buffered saline + BSA (1 mg/mL) (total reaction volume about 26 uL!).6. Incubate for 15 minutes at 37C.7. Prepare lysing/fixative reagent by mixing red cell lysing solution (ammonium chloride/potassium bicarbonate) with white cell fixative reagent (formaldehyde).8. Add 30 uL lysing/fixative reagent (total reaction volume about 60 uL).9. Incubate 15 minutes at 37C10. Sediment the white cells by centrifugation (5 mm, 10,000 g).11. Remove the supernatant hemolysate (about 57 uL).12. Re-suspend the white cells by adding 8 uL buffer (isotonic buffered saline).13. Measure the volume accurately.14. Deliver sample (c 10 uL) to cytometry.[003211    The steps may include receiving a sample. The sample may be a bodily fluid, such as blood, or any other sample described elsewhere herein. The sample may be a small volume, such as any of the volume measurements described elsewhere herein. In some instances, the sample may have an anti-coagulant.Concentration will be adjusted appropriately to deal with the different volume ratio relative to standard laboratory method (specifically about 5 x lower) 2 If necessary, this volume can be bigger to have optimal staining but not more than 50 uL. \n-31-;A 028251962013-07-18 [00322]    A separation step may occur. For example, a density-based separation may occur. Such separation may occur via centrifugation, magnetic separation, lysis, or any other separation technique known in the art. In some embodiments, the sample may be blood, and the red and white blood cells may be separated.[00323]    A measurement may be made. In some instances, the measurement may be made via imaging, or any other detection mechanism described elsewhere herein. For example, the hematocrit of a separated blood sample may be made by imaging. Imaging may occur via a digital camera or any other image capture device described herein.[00324]    One or more component of a sample may be removed. For example, if the sample is separated into solid and liquid components, the liquid component may be moved. The plasma of a blood sample may be removed. In some instances, the liquid component, such as plasma, may be removed via a pipette. The liquid component may be removed without disturbing the solid component. The imaging may aid in the removal of the liquid component, or any other selected component of the sample. For example, the imaging may be used to determine where the plasma is located and may aid in the placement of the pipette to remove the plasma.[00325]    In some embodiments, a reagent or other material may be added to the sample. For example, the solid portion of the sample may be resuspended. A material may be added with a label. One or more incubation step may occur. In some instances, a lysing and/or fixative reagent may be added. Additional separation and/or resuspending steps may occur. As needed, dilution and/or concentration steps may occur.[00326]    The volume of the sample may be measured. In some instances, the volume of the sample may be measured in a precise and/or accurate fashion. The volume of the sample may be measured in a system with a low coefficient of variation, such as coefficient of variation values described elsewhere herein. In some instances, the volume of the sample may be measured using imaging. An image of the sample may be captured and the volume of the sample may be calculated from the image.[00327]    The sample may be delivered to a desired process. For example, the sample may be delivered for cytometry.[00328]    In another example, a typical protocol that may or may not make use of the centrifuge for nucleic acid purification may include one or more of the following steps. The system may enable DNA/RNA extraction to deliver nucleic acid template to exponential amplification reactions for detection. The process may be designed to extract nucleic acids from a variety of samples including, but not limited to whole blood, serum, viral transfer medium, human and animal tissue samples, food samples, and bacterial cultures. The process may be completely automated and may extract DNA/RNA in a consistent and quantitative manner. The steps below may be provided in varying orders or other steps may be substituted for any of the steps below:[00329]    1. Sample Lysis. Celts in the sample may be lysed using a chaotropic-salt buffer. The chaotropic-salt buffer may include one or more of the following: chaotropic salt such as, but not limited to, 3-6 Mguanidine hydrochloride or guaniclinium thiocyanate; sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) at a typical concentration of 0.1-5% v/v; ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) at a typical concentration of 1-5mM; lysozyme at a typical concentration oft mg/mL; proteinase-K at a typical concentration of 1 mg/mL; and pH may be set at 7-7.5 using a buffer such as HEPES. In some embodiments, the sample may be incubated in the buffer at typical temperature of 20-95  C for 0-30 minutes. Isopropanol (50%-100% v/v) may be added to the mixture after lysis.[00330]    2. Surface Loading. Lysed sample may be exposed to a functionalized surface (often in the form of a packed bed of beads) such as, but not limited to, a resin-support packed in a chromatography style column, ;A 028251962013-07-18 magnetic bcads mixed with the sample in a batch style manner, sample pumped through a suspended resin in a fluidized-bed mode, and sample pumped through a closed channel in a tangential flow manner over the surface. The surface may be functionalized so as to bind nucleic acids (e.g. DNA, RNA, DNA/RNA hybrid) in the presence of the lysis buffer. Surface types may include silica, and ion-exchange functional groups such as diethylaminoethanol (DEAE). The lyscd mixture may be exposed to the surface and nucleic acids bind.[00331]    3. Wash. The solid surface is washed with a salt solution such as 0-2 M sodium chloride and ethanol (20-80% v/v) at pH 7.0 - 7.5. The washing may be done in the same manner as loading.[00332]    4. Elution. Nucleic acids may be eluted from the surface by exposing the surface to water or buffer at pET 7-9. Elution may be performed in the same manner as loading.[00333]    Many variations of these protocols or other protocols may be employed by the system. Such protocols may be used in combination or in the place of any protocols or methods described herein.[00334]    In some embodiments, it is important to be able to recover the cells packed and concentrated by centrifugation for cytometry. In some embodiments, this may be achieved by use of the pipetting device. Liquids (typically isotonic buffered saline, a lysing agent, a mixture of a lysing agent and a fixative or a cocktail of labeled antibodies in buffer) may be dispensed into the centrifuge bucket and repeatedly aspirated and re-dispensed. The tip of the pipette may be forced into the packed cells to facilitate the process. Image analysis aids the process by objectively verifying that all the cells have been re-suspended.[00335]    Use of the pipette and centrifuge to process samples prior to analysis:[00336]    In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, the system may have pipetting, pick-and-place and centrifugal capabilities. Such capabilities may enable almost any type of sample pretreatment and complex assay procedures to be performed efficiently with very small volumes of sample.[00337]    Specifically, the system may enables separation of formed elements (red and white cells) from plasma. The system may also enable re-suspension of formed elements. In some embodiments, the system may enable concentration of white cells from fixed and hemolysed blood. The system may also enable lysis of cells to release nucleic acids. In some embodiments, purification and concentration of nucleic acids by filtration through tips packed with (typically beaded) solid phase reagents (e.g. silica) may be enabled by the system. The system may also permit elution of purified nucleic acids following solid phase extraction. Removal and collection of precipitates (for example LDL-cholesterol precipitated using polyethylene glycol) may also be enabled by the system.[00338]    In some embodiments, the system may enable affinity purification. Small molecules such as vitamin-D and serotonin may be adsorbed onto beaded (particulate) hydrophobic substrates, then eluted using organic solvents. Antigens may be provided onto antibody-coated substrates and eluted with acid. The same methods can be used to concentrate analytcs found at low concentrations such as thromboxanc-B2 and 6-keto-prostaglandin F la. Antigens may be provided onto antibody or aptamer-coated substrates and then eluted.[00339]    In some embodients, the system may enable chemical modification of analytes prior to assay. To assay serotonin (5-Hydroxytryptamine) for example, it may be required to convert the analyte to a derivative (such as an acetylated form) using a reagent (such as acetic anhydride). This may be done to produce a form of the analyte that can be recognized by an antibody.[00340]    Liquids can be moved using the pipette (vacuum aspiration and pumping). The pipette may be limited to relatively low positive and negative pressures (approximately 0.1 ¨ 2.0 atmospheres). A centrifuge ;A 028251962013-07-18 can be used to generate much higher pressures whcn needed to force liquids through beaded solid phasc media. For example, using a rotor with a radius of 5 cm at a speed of 10,000 rpm, forces of about 5,000 x g (about 7 atmospheres) may be generated, sufficient to force liquids through resistive media such as packed beds. Any of the centrifuge designs and configurations discussed elsewhere herein or known in the art may be used.[00341]    Measurement of hematocrit with very small volumes of blood may occur. For example, inexpensive digital cameras are capable of making good images of small objects even when the contrast is poor. Making use of this capability, the system of the present invention may enable automated measurement of hematocrit with a very small volume of blood.[00342]    For example, 1 uL of blood may be drawn into a rnicrocap glass capillary. The capillary may then be sealed with a curable adhesive and then subject to centrifugation at 10,000 x g for 5 minutes. The packed cell volume may be easily measured and the plasma meniscus (indicated by an arrow) may also be visible so hematocrit can be accurately measured. This may enable the system to not waste a relatively large volume of blood to make this measurement. In some embodiments, the camera may be used \"as is\" without operation with a microscope to make a larger image. In other embodiments, a microscope or other optical techniques may be used to magnify the image. In one implementation, the hematocrit was determined using the digital camera without additional optical interference, and the hematocrit measured was identical to that determined by a conventional microhematocrit laboratory method requiring many microliters of sample. In some embodiments, the length of the sample column and of that of the column of packed red cells can be measured very precisely (+1- <0.05 mm). Given that the blood sample column may be about 10 - 20 mm, the standard deviation of hematocrit may be much better than 1 % matching that obtained by standard laboratory methods.[00343]    The system may enable measurement of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). The ability of digital cameras to measure very small distances and rates of change of distances may be exploited to measure ESR. In one example, three blood samples (15 uL) were aspirated into \"reaction tips\". Images were captured over one hour at two-minute intervals. Image analysis was used to measure the movement of the interface between red cells and plasma. Figure 122 shows results as distance of the interface from the plasma meniscus.[00344]    The precision of the measurement may be estimated by fitting the data to a polynomial function and calculating the standard deviation of the difference between the data and the fitted curve (for all samples). In the example, this was determined to be 0.038 mm or < 2 % CV when related to the distance moved over one hour. Accordingly, ESR can be measured precisely by this method. Another method for determination of ESR is to measure the maximum slope of the distance versus time relationship.[00345]    Assay Preparation [00346]    In some embodiments, tips can be designed to accommodate a plurality of reactions or assays. Simultaneous measurement of several different assay mixtures and one or more controls or one or more calibrators can be made within one tip of the present invention. In doing this we exploit the ability to sample several liquid sources by sequential aspiration of liquids into the same tip. Effective segmentation and separation of the liquids is greatly improved by aspirating in sequence a small volume of air and a small volume of a wash solution which cleans the surface of the tips prior to aspiration of the next liquid of interest.[00347]    As described above, tips can have conical shapes. In some embodiments, an assay can require oxygen as a reactant. In such reactions, increasing availability of oxygen within a reaction can be achieved by moving the sample and/or assay mixture to a wide part of tip to increase surface area to volume ratio.   ;A 028251962013.07-18 [00348]    In Figure 93 and Figure 94, solutions of brompbenol blue were aspirated into tips. The uppermost segments (aspirated first) 6 uL are from a two-fold dilution series (highest concentration (0.0781 mg/mL) to the right of the image, with the exception of the left-most tip which is a water blank). Then air (2 uL), wash solution (2 uL) respectively were aspirated followed by a 6 uL volume of a fixed concentration control solution (0.625 mg/mL).[00349]    Using this approach several alternative assay configurations can be achieved, for example:[00350]    1. Simultaneous measurement of reagent and/or sample blank and assay [00351]    2. Simultaneous measurement of sample, blank and control [00352]    3. Within-tip calibration of assay [00353]    The table below illustrates some \"multiplex types\" in which preferred combinations of assays, controls and calibrators are assembled within a tip.Multiplex Type                    Zone # Top                                                                   Bottom Assay with controls     Air    Controll     Air    Wash    Air Assay    Air Wash    Control2 Three assays    Air     Assayl    Air       Wash    Air Assay2    Air    Wash Air    Assay3    Air Calibration series      Air    Call         Air    Wash     Air Cal2    Air Wash    Air    Cal3    Air Assay with blank    Air    Assay    Air     Wash    Air Blank    Air [00354]    Case 2 is shown in Figure 95.[00355]    Serial measurements of blank solutions, sample, controls and calibrators can also be made with single tips. In this scenario, the tip is filled with the first solution, read then emptied. The tip can then be re-filled and read with other samples etc. in sequence. The impact of \"carry-over\" of colored product from one sample to the next is minimized by either or both:[00356]    1. Reading the liquid column in the middle portion well away from that part that first comes into contact with the preceding sample [00357]    2. Washing the tip between samples.[00358]    In order to measure the extent of 'carry-over\" from one liquid segment to the next, the following procedure was be performed. A small amount (e.g. 6 uL) of a high concentration of bromphenol blue (e.g. 0.625 mg/mL) was aspirated into tips, followed by 2 uL of air and 2 uL of wash solution. Finally 6 uL of serial two-fold dilutions of bromphenol blue is aspirated with the following results (highest concentration (0.0781 mg/mL) to the right; left most tip is a water blank).[00359]    As can be seen from the images shown in Figure 96 and the 3-color analysis shown in Figure 97, measurable amounts of the high concentration solution is transferred into the wash solution.[00360]    Average carry-over (from high concentration control to the water wash) is calculated at 1.4 %. Since, in effect, the leading zone (proximal to the earlier slug) of a later slug of liquid acts as second wash step and the color reading is taken at a location remote from this leading zone (typically at a central zone of the slug), the effective carryover from one slug to the next is typically much less than 1 % and therefore generally insignificant. When the dilution series is measured using only dilution series samples to fill the tips, results are identical with those obtained above. The above represents a \"stress test\" designed to evaluate the extent of carry-over.   ;A 028251962013-07-18 [00361]    Figure 98 shows a tip containing reaction products for two commercially available assays for ionized calcium, Ca2+ (upper segment) and magnesium Mg2+ (lower segment) that were aspirated into tips for measurement. Ca2+ concentrations used in this experiment are 0, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, and 40 mg/dL; Mg2+ concentrations arc 0, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, 20 mg/dL. Assay reaction mixtures (6 uL [Ca2+] and 4 uL [Mg2+]) arc well separated using 2 uL of air, 3 uL of wash and a further 4 uL of air. Results for each assay read in this way are essentially identical to those measured having only one assay reaction mixture per tip.[00362]    As noted above, the present invention allows for simultaneous evaluation of a plurality of assays. Images can be made of many assay cuvettes in the same field of view. Specifically, simultaneous evaluation of assays and controls in the same assay cuvette can be performed. Simultaneous evaluation of several assays in the same assay cuvette can be also performed.[00363]    Reaction Environment [00364]    A system can comprise a heating block for heating the assay or assay unit and/or for control of the assay temperature. Heat can be used in the incubation step of an assay reaction to promote the reaction and shorten the duration necessary for the incubation step. A system can comprise a heating block configured to receive an assay unit of the invention. The heating block can be configured to receive a plurality of assay units from a device of the invention. For example, if 8 assays are desired to be run on a device, the heating block can be configured to receive 8 assay units. In some embodiments, assay units can be moved into thermal contact with a heating block using the means for moving the assay units. The heating can be performed by a heating means known in the art.[00365]    Protocol Optimization [00366]    Assay protocols for analyzing samples can be optimized in a variety of manners. When multiple assays are to be run on a sample, all protocols can be optimized to the most stringent reaction conditions, or each assay protocol can be optimized based on the desired performance of a particular assay.[00367]    In some embodiments, a single protocol that can be designed to meet the test requirements under all possible use cases. For example, on a multiplex cartridge, a single protocol may be specified based on the case when all tests on the cartridge are to be performed (i.e., the limiting case). This protocol can be designed to meet the minimal test requirements, such as the precision and dynamic range for each test on the cartridge. However, this approach can be suboptimal for alternate use cases, for example, when only a subset of tests on the cartridge is to be performed. In these cases, by using more sample, some assays can achieve improved performance in terms of sensitivity and precision. There can be a trade-off between how much sample is allocated to an assay and assay sensitivity. For example, an assay which has a sensitivity of 1 unit/mL when the sample is diluted 1:100 may be able to detect 0.1 unit/mL if the dilution factor is increased to 1:10. One downside of using a lower dilution factor in a multiplexed assay system with restricted sample volume can be that the fraction of the sample required for this assay is increased by 10-fold even when using the minimal volume to perform the assay. Likewise, assay precision may be improved by using a higher sample concentration. For example, an assay which results in a signal of (say) 0.1 absorbance +1- 0.02 (20 % signal imprecision) at its limit of detection can be improved by use of 10 times the sample concentration such that the signal produced is 10 times greater giving a signal of 0.1 +11 0.02 OD at an analyte concentration ten times lower and at signal of 1.0, +/- 0.02 the imprecision is now only 2 %. The reason this is the case is that typically assay signal (at the lower range of analyte concentrations) is directly proportional to the analyte concentration ;A 028251962013-07-18 (and therefore to the sample concentration) whereas the signal imprecision can be typically related to the square root of the signal and so increases as the square root of analyte concentration (and sample concentration). Thus, the coefficient of variation (CV) of the signal can be inversely proportional to the square root of the signal; such that a 10-fold increase in signal corresponds to approximately three-fold decrease in signal CV. Since concentration CV is typically directly related to signal CV, the concentration CV will decrease with increased sample concentration (decreased dilution).[00368]    Protocols can be optimized to specific use cases rather than the typical one-size fits all approach described above. For example, the protocol may be optimized to enhance the precision of each test being performed in the multiplex device. Moreover, some tests may be prioritized relative to other tests for optimization. Protocol optimization can be pre-computed for use cases that are known a priori. Protocol optimization can also be performed in real-time for new use cases not known a priori. System validation can be performed to span the suite of use cases.[00369]    One example of protocol optimization is described below comparing two uses cases. For both use cases, 8 uL of undiluted sample is available to run the required tests. In this example, the multiplex cartridge has 20 tests on board, where 5 of the tests require 1:5 dilution and 15 of the tests require 1:25 dilution.[00370]    In the first use case, all tests are required to be run on the sample. The protocol in this use case (Use-case B) is as follows:[00371]    1) Prepare 1:5 dilution (8 uL sample + 32 uL diluent) [00372]    2) Prepare 1:25 dilution (15uL 1:5 sample + 60 uL diluent) [00373]    3) For each test (n = 20), mix 5 uL of appropriately diluted sample with 10 uL of the reagent This protocol results in concentration imprecision of 10% CV for all 20 tests, meeting the minimal requirements. The sample usage is 1 uL for each 1:5 dilution assay and 0.2 uL for each 1:25 dilution assay (for a total of 5*1 + 15*0.2 = 8 uL, using all the available sample).[00374]    In the second use case (Use-case \"B\") with the same cartridge type, only 10 tests are required to be run for the sample, not all 20. Moreover, all these 10 tests would be performed at the 1:25 dilution level in use-case A. The protocol is optimized for this use case to maximize precision for all the tests by using a lower dilution (1:5). The optimized protocol for this specific use case is as follows:[00375]    1) Prepare 1:5 dilution (8 uL sample + 32 uL diluent) [00376]    2) For each test (n = 10), mix 4 uL of diluted sample with 11 uL of reagent [00377]    Sample usage is 0.8 uL undiluted sample per assay for a total of 8 uL. Since the sample concentration in the assay is increased by 5-fold relative to that for use-case A, the assay sensitivity is improved by a factor of 5 and the assay imprecision is reduced by about 2.4 (5^0.5) fold to about 4.5  A.[00378]    By re-optimizing the protocol, in use case B employs 5-times as much original sample for each test, thereby improving overall performance. Note that the above discussion does not account for any imprecision due to errors in metering of volumes but only addresses errors due to imprecision in measurement of optical signal. Use-case B would have a lower imprecision due to imprecision in volumes since it uses fewer pipetting steps. For example if the volume imprecision introduces 5 % imprecision in the reported analyte concentration in both use cases there would be a total analyte imprecision of 11.2 % (1(Y2 + 5^2)^0.5 in use-case A compared with 6.5 % (4.5A2+5A2)^0.5 in use-case B (assuming, as is generally true, that factors causing imprecision in assays aggregate as the square root of the sum of squares of each source of imprecision).   ;A 028251962013-07-18 [00379]    The effects illustrated above can more easily be seen in the case of luminescence-based assays where the assay signal is expressed as a number of photons emitted per unit time. As is the case for counting of radioactive emissions in for example radioimmunoassay, the signal imprecision is equal to the square root of the signal and thus the signal CV is 100/ (square root of signal). For example, a signal of 10,000 counts will have a CV of 1 %. In many assays which produce photons (for example chemiluminescence immunoassays, the signal is almost exactly proportional to analyte concentration, at least at the lower concentration range). Thus the measured analyte imprecision scales with 1/ (square root of signal) for concentrations significantly above the limit of detection. In assays which utilize dilution of the sample, the measured analyte imprecision will therefore scale as 1/ (sample dilution). For example, an assay using a 1:100 dilution of sample will have signal and concentration CVs about 3.2 fold (10^0.5) higher than an assay using a dilution 1: 10 (and will also have a sensitivity about 10-times higher).[00380]    Reaction Chemistries [00381]    A variety of assays may be performed on a fluidic device according to the present invention to detect an analyte of interest in a sample. Where a label is utilized in the assay, one may choose from a wide diversity of labels is available in the art that can be employed for conducting the subject assays. In some embodiments labels are detectable by spectroscopic, photochemical, biochemical, electrochemical, immunocheinical, or other chemical means. For example, useful nucleic acid labels include the, fluorescent dyes, electron-dense reagents, and enzymes. A wide variety of labels suitable for labeling biological components are known and are reported extensively in both the scientific and patent literature, and are generally applicable to the present invention for the labeling of biological components. Suitable labels include, enzymes, fluorescent moieties, chemiluminescent moieties, bioluminescent labels, or colored labels. Reagents defining assay specificity optionally include, for example, monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, aptamers, proteins, nucleic acid probes or other polymers such as affinity matrices, carbohydrates or lipids. Detection can proceed by any of a variety of known methods, including spectrophotometric or optical tracking of fluorescent, or luminescent markers, or other methods which track a molecule based upon size, charge or affinity. A detectable moiety can be of any material having a detectable physical or chemical property. Such detectable labels have been well-developed in the field of gel electrophoresis, column chromatography, solid substrates, spectroscopic techniques, and the like, and in general, labels useful in such methods can be applied to the present invention. Thus, a label includes without limitation any composition detectable by spectroscopic, photochemical, biochemical, immunochemical, nucleic acid probe-based, electrical, optical thermal, or other chemical means.[00382]    In some embodiments the label (such as a colored compound, fluor or enzyme) is coupled directly or indirectly to a molecule to be detected, according to methods well known in the art. In other embodiments, the label is attached to a receptor for the analyte (such as an antibody, nucleic acid probe, aptamer etc.). As indicated above, a wide variety of labels are used, with the choice of label depending on the sensitivity required, ease of conjugation of the compound, stability requirements, available instrumentation, and disposal provisions. Non-radioactive labels are often attached by indirect means. Generally, a receptor specific to the analyte is linked to a signal-generating moiety. Sometimes the analyte receptor is linked to an adaptor molecule (such as biotin or avidin) and the assay reagent set includes a binding moiety (such as a biotinylated reagent or avidin) that binds to the adaptor and to the analyte. The analyte binds to a specific receptor on the reaction site. A labeled reagent can form a sandwich complex in which the analyte is in the center. The reagent can also ;A 028251962013-07-18 compete with thc analytc for receptors on the reaction site or bind to vacant receptors on the reaction site not occupied by analyte. The label is either inherently detectable or bound to a signal system, such as a detectable enzyme, a fluorescent compound, a chemiluminescent compound, or a chemiluminogenic entity such as an enzyme with a luminogenic substrate. A number of ligands and anti-ligands can be used. Where a ligand has a natural anti-ligand, for example, biotin, thyroxine, digoxigenin, and cortisol, it can be used in conjunction with labeled, anti-ligands. Alternatively, any haptenic or antigenic compound can be used in combination with an antibody.[00383]    Enzymes of interest as labels will primarily be hydrolases, particularly phosphatases, esterases and glycosidases, or oxidoreductases, particularly peroxidases. Fluorescent compounds include fluorescein and its derivatives, rhodamine and its derivatives, dansyl groups, and umbelliferone. Chemiluminescent compounds include dioxetanes, acridinium esters, luciferin, and 2,3-dihydrophthalazinediones, such as luminol.[00384]    Methods of detecting labels are well known to those of skilled in the art. Thus, for example, where the label is fluorescent, it may be detected by exciting the fluorochrome with light of an appropriate wavelength and detecting the resulting fluorescence by, for example, microscopy, visual inspection, via photographic film, by the use of electronic detectors such as digital cameras, charge coupled devices (CCDs) or photomultipliers and phototubes, or other detection devices. Similarly, enzymatic labels are detected by providing appropriate substrates for the enzyme and detecting the resulting reaction product spectroscopically or by digital imaging (the subject or the present invention). Finally, simple colorirnetric labels are often detected simply by observing the color associated with the label. For example, colloidal gold sols often appear pink, while various beads doped with dyes are strongly colored.[00385]    In some embodiments the detectable signal may be provided by luminescence sources. Luminescence is the term commonly used to refer to the emission of light from a substance for any reason other than a rise in its temperature. In general, atoms or molecules emit photons of electromagnetic energy (e.g., light) when they transition from an excited state to a lower energy state (usually the ground state). If the exciting agent is a photon, the luminescence process is referred to as photoluminescence or fluorescence. If the exciting cause is an electron, the luminescence process can be referred to as electroluminescence. More specifically, electroluminescence results from the direct injection and removal of electrons to form an electron-hole pair, and subsequent recombination of the electron-hole pair to emit a photon. Luminescence which results from a chemical reaction is usually referred to as chemiluminescence. Luminescence produced by a living organism is usually referred to as bioluminescence. If photoluminescence is the result of a spin allowed transition (e.g., a single-singlet transition, triplet-triplet transition), the photoluminescence process is usually referred to as fluorescence. Typically, fluorescence emissions do not persist after the exciting cause is removed as a result of short-lived excited states which may rapidly relax through such spin allowed transitions. If photoluminescence is the result of a spin forbidden transition (e.g., a triplet-singlet transition), the photoluminescence process is usually referred to as phosphorescence. Typically, phosphorescence emissions persist long after the exciting cause is removed as a result of long-lived excited states which may relax only through such spin-forbidden transitions. A luminescent label may have any one of the above-described properties.[00386]    Suitable chemiluminescent sources include a compound which becomes electronically excited by a chemical reaction and may then emit light which serves as the detectible signal or donates energy to a fluorescent acceptor. A diverse number of families of compounds have been found to provide ;A 028251962013-07-18 chemiluminescence under a variety of conditions. One family of compounds is 2,3-dihydro-1,4-phthalazinedione. A frequently used compound is luminol, which is a 5-amino compound. Other members of the family include the 5-amino-6, 7, 8-trimethoxy- and the dimethylamino[ca]benz analog. These compounds can be made to luminesce with alkaline hydrogen peroxide or calcium hypochlorite and base. Another family of compounds is the 2,4,5-triphenylimidazoles, with lophine as the common name for the parent product. Chemiluminescent analogs include para-dimethylamino and -methoxy substituents. Chemiluminescence may also be obtained with oxalates, usually oxalyl active esters, for example, p-nitrophenyl and a peroxide such as hydrogen peroxide, under basic conditions. Other useful chemiluminescent compounds that are also known include -N-alkyl acridinum esters and dioxetanes. Alternatively, luciferins may be used in conjunction with luciferase or lucigenins to provide bioluminescence. Especially preferred chemiluminescent sources are \"himinogenic\" enzyme substrates such as dioxetane-phosphate esters. These are not luminescent but produce luminescent products when acted on by phosphatases such as alkaline phosphatase. The use of luminogenic substrates for enzymes is particularly preferred because the enzyme acts as an amplifier capable of converting thousands of substrate molecules per second to product. Luminescence methods are also preferred because the signal (light) can be detected both very sensitively and over a huge dynamic range using PMTs.[00387]    The term analytes as used herein includes without limitation drugs, prodrugs, pharmaceutical agents, drug metabolites, biomarkers such as expressed proteins and cell markers, antibodies, serum proteins, cholesterol and other metabolites, electrolytes, metal ions, polysaccharides, nucleic acids, biological analytes, biomarkers, genes, proteins, hormones, or any combination thereof. Analytes can be combinations of polypeptides, glycoproteins, polysaccharides, lipids, and nucleic acids.[00388]    The system can be used to detect and/or quantify a variety of analytes. For example, analytes that can be detected and/or quantified include Albumin, Alkaline Phosphatase, ALT, AST, Bilirubin (Direct), Bilirubin (Total), Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN), Calcium, Chloride, Cholesterol, Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Creatinine, Gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase (GGT), Globulin, Glucose, HDL-cholesterol, Hemoglobin, Elomocysteine, Iron, Lactate Dehydrogenase, Magnesium, Phosphorous, Potassium, Sodium, Total Protein, Triglycerides, and Uric Acid. The detection and/or quantification of these analytes can be performed using optical, electrical, or any other type of measurements.[00389]    Of particular interest are biomarkers which are associated with a particular disease or with a specific disease stage. Such analytes include but are not limited to those associated with autoimmune diseases, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, neuronal and/or muscular degenerative diseases, cardiac diseases, endocrine disorders, metabolic disorders, inflammation, cardiovascular diseases, sepsis, angiogenesis, cancers, Alzheimer's disease, athletic complications, and any combinations thereof.[00390]    Of also interest are biomarkers that are present in varying abundance in one or more of the body tissues including heart, liver, prostate, lung, kidney, bone marrow, blood, skin, bladder, brain, muscles, nerves, and selected tissues that are affected by various disease, such as different types of cancer (malignant or non-metastatic), autoimmune diseases, inflammatory or degenerative diseases.[00391]    Also of interest are analytes that are indicative of a microorganism, virus, or Chlamydiaceae. Exemplary microorganisms include but are not limited to bacteria, viruses, fungi and protozoa.

One example of such chemistry is shown in Figure 52 and Figure 53. [00421] NADH or NADPH[00422]    Production or consumption of NADH or NADPH are frequently used in clinical assays. This is because these coenzymes are common substrates for enzymes. For example, measurement of enzymes of clinical interest such as lactate dehydogenase (LDH) can be measured by the rate of production of NADH. Since NADH absorbs light maximally at 340 nm and (1) polystyrene and other plastics transmit light poorly in the near UV, (2) White light sources produce little light in the near UV and (3) camera and scanner sensors have low sensitivity to near UV light, it is not practical to measure NADH by three color image analysis. To deal with this issue NADH can be converted to a colored product using tetrazolium salts such as Water Soluble Tetrazolium (e.g.W ST-1 (Dojindo Molecular Technologies) plus an \"electron mediator\" such as 1-Methoxyphenazine methosulfate (PMS).[00423]    In some embodiments, assays that produce or consume NADH or NADPH can be paired with other reactions that allow for colorimetric measurement. For example, NADH or NADPH can be used to reduce compounds such as 2-(4-Iodopheny1)-3-(4-nitropheny1)-5-(2,4-disulfopheny1)-2H-tetrazolium, monosodium salt (WST-1) to a colored formezan dye as shown below with the use of phenazine methosulfate as an electron mediator, as shown in Figure 54.[00424]    As shown in Figure 73, when NADH, WST-1 and PMS are combined at millimolar concentrations, a yellow product (shown in tips indicated as Mixture) is formed.[00425]    Using this chemistry, an assay for LDH was set up. Lactate (mM), NAD (mM) and LDH were combined and incubated at 37C for 10 minutes before addition of WST-1 and PMS. A good dose-response to ;A 028251962013-07-18 LDH was obtained as shown in Figure 74 for two-fold serial dilutions of LDH (1000 IU/L) (left to right) corresponding to the OD 450 nm values shown in the graph in Figure 75.[00426]    Alkaline Phosphatase [00427]    In other embodiments, assays utilizing enzymes such as alkaline phosphatase can be measured using a chromogenic substrate such as p-nitrophenyl phosphate. The enzymatic reaction can make p-nitrophenol which is yellow in alkaline conditions.[00428]    Metal ions [00429]    Measurements can also be performed on assays that form colored complex, such as between a metal ion a chelating dye which changes color on binding. For example, o-Cresolphthatein Complexone (shown in Figure 55) forms a complex with calcium, which has a different color than the reagent. The general scheme of such assays is: Chelating dye (color 1) +    <-> Chelating dye: MN+:(Color 2) [00430]    Optical signals can also be measured for metal ion assays using metal-dependant enzymes. For example, sodium ions can be determined enzymatically via sodium dependent 13-galactosidase activity with o-nitro-phenyl galactoside (ONPG) as the substrate. The absorbance at 405 nm of the product o-nitrophenol is proportional to the sodium concentration.[00431]    ELISAs [00432]    Assays can be performed for analytes by color-forming ELISAs. Many ELISA methods are known which generate color using enzymes such as horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase and 13-gal actosidase with chromogenic substrates such as o-phenylene diamine, p-nitrophenyl phosphate, and o-nitrophenyl galactoside respectively. Such assays can be readily performed and read by the subject invention.[00433]    Luminogenic immunoassays [00434]    Luminogenic immunoassays can also be performed. Assays can utilize chemiluminogenic entities such as an enzyme with a luminogenic substrate. For example, chemiluminescent compounds include dioxetanes, acridinium esters, luciferin, and 2,3-dihydrophthalazinediones, such as luminol.[00435]    Furthermore, suitable cheiniluminescent sources include a compound which becomes electronically excited by a chemical reaction and may then emit light which serves as the detectible signal or donates energy to a fluorescent acceptor. A diverse number of families of compounds have been found to provide chemiluminescence under a variety of conditions. One family of compounds is 2,3-dihydro-1,4-phthalazinedione. A frequently used compound is luminol, which is a 5-amino compound. Other members of the family include the 5-amino-6, 7, 8-trimethoxy- and the dimethylamino[ca]benz analog. These compounds can be made to luminesce with alkaline hydrogen peroxide or calcium hypochlorite and base. Another family of compounds is the 2,4,5-triphenylimidazoles, with lophine as the common name for the parent product. Chemiluminescent analogs include para-dimethylamino and -mcthoxy substituents. Chemiluminescence may also be obtained with oxalates, usually oxalyl active esters, for example, p-nitrophenyl and a peroxide such as hydrogen peroxide, under basic conditions. Other useful chemiluminescent compounds that are also known include N-alkyl acridinum esters and dioxetanes. Alternatively, luciferins may be used in conjunction with luciferase or lucigenins to provide bioluminescence.[00436]    Nucleic Acid Amplification [00437]    Assays that can be performed also include nucleic acid amplification. Among these assays, isothermal amplification and Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification Assays (LAMP) are examples. Nucleic ;A 028251962013.07-18 acid amplification can be used to produce visibly turbid, fluorescent or colored assay reaction products for analytes such as nucleic acid targets (genes etc.). Nucleic acid amplification technology can be used for isothermal amplification of specific DNA and RNA targets. Additional information on isothermal nucleic acid amplification is described in Goto et al., \"Colorimetric detection of loop-mediated isothermal amplification reaction by using hydroxy naphthol blue\", BioTechniques, Vol. 46, No. 3, March 2009, 167-172.[00438]    Nucleic acid amplification can be used to measure DNA and, coupled with the use of reverse transcriptase, RNA. Once the reaction has occurred, the amplified product can be detected optically using intercalating dyes or chromogenic reagents that react with released pyrophosphate generated as a side product of the amplification.[00439]    The reaction can be visualized by changes (increases) in color, fluorescence or turbidity. Very small copy numbers of DNA can be detected in less than one hour. This technology can advantageously be read out in the present invention using three-color image analysis. As shown below, images of isothermal nucleic acid amplification assay reaction products can be measured by (1) back lit-illumination (transmission optics) measuring absorbance of light, (2) images captured by a digital camera of light transmitted through a reaction product or (3) fluorescent light images generated by illumination of reaction products with a UV source (or any other appropriate light source) captured by a digital camera.[00440]    The nucleic acid amplification assay is generally performed in a \"one-pot\" format where sample and reagents are combined in a sealed tube and incubated at elevated temperature. In some formats, the reaction can be monitored in real time by changes in optical properties. In other assay formats the reaction is stopped and reaction products visualized after adding a chromogcnic or fluorogenic reagent. The present invention allows for the reading of nucleic acid amplification assay products directly in the reaction vessel or after aspiration into the tips described herein.[00441]    Turbidity [00442]    The invention also provides for optical turbidirnetric assays. For example, immunoassays can be set up by measurement of the agglutination of small latex particles (50 - 300 nm). In these assays the particles can be coated with an antigen and/or antibody and agglutination occurs when a binding counterpart in the sample such as antibody or antigen is added. Assays can be set up as direct (e.g. antibody on the particle reacting with a multi-epitope protein or biomarker) or the competitive mode (e.g. drug hapten on particle reacts with anti-drug antibody in competition with free drug in the sample). The dispersion of latex becomes more turbid and the turbidity can be measured as decreased transmission of light using 3-color optics.[00443]    Similarly, assays based on the agglutination of large latex particles (diameter about 1 um) or red blood cells can be measured. Assay configuration is similar to turbidimetric assays as disclosed above, but the measurement can be by image analysis (scanner or camera measurement) using software to interpret the number and size of the agglutinates.[00444]    Reagents for performing reaction chemistries can be included in the cartridges described here, such as in pipette tips. The reagents can be stored as liquids or in dried, lyophilized, or glassy forms.[00445]    Localized Reagents [00446]    In some embodiments, the location and configuration of a reaction site is an important element in an assay device. Most, if not all, disposable immunoassay devices have been configured with their capture surface as an integral part of the device.   ;A 028251962013.07-18 [00447]    In one embodiment, a molded plastic assay unit is either commercially available or can be made by injection molding with precise shapes and sizes. For example, the characteristic dimension can be a diameter of 0.05 ¨ 3 mm or can be a length of 3 to 30 mm. The units can be coated with capture reagents using method similar to those used to coat microtiter plates but with the advantage that they can be processed in bulk by placing them in a large vessel, adding coating reagents and processing using sieves, holders, and the like to recover the pieces and wash them as needed.[00448]    The assay unit (e.g. encompassing the tip disclosed herein, tips, vessels, or any other containers) can offer a rigid support on which a reactant can be immobilized. The assay unit is also chosen to provide appropriate characteristics with respect to interactions with light. For example, the assay unit can be made of a material, such as functionalized glass, Si, Ge, GaAs, GaP, SiO2, SiN4, modified silicon, or any one of a wide variety of gels or polymers such as (poly)tetrafluoroethylene, (poly)vinylidenedifluoride, polystyrene, polyearbonate, polypropylene, polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS), or combinations thereof. In an embodiment, an assay unit comprises polystyrene. In some embodiments, the assay unit may be formed from a homogeneous material, heterogeneous material, clad material, coated material, impregnated material, and/or embedded material. Other appropriate materials may be used in accordance with the present invention. A transparent reaction site may be advantageous. In addition, in the case where there is an optically transmissive window permitting light to reach an optical detector, the surface may be advantageously opaque and/or preferentially light scattering. In some embodiments, the assay unit may be formed from a transparent material. Alternatively, a portion of the assay unit may be formed from a transparent material.[00449]    The assay unit may have a reagent coated thereon and/or impregnated therein. In some embodiments, the reagent may be a capture reagent capable of immobilizing a reactant on a capture surface. The reactant may be a cell and/or analyte, or any other reactant described elsewhere herein. In some embodiments, the reagent may be a molecule that may be a cell capture agent. A cell capture agent may anchor to the surface of desired cells during fluid transport. In some embodiments, the capture reagents may be an antibody, peptide, organic molecule (e.g., which may have a lipid chain, lipophilic molecule), polymer matrix, protein, protein composite, glycoprotein, that may interact with the cell membrane. Capture reagents may be molecules, cross-linked molecules, nanoparticles, nanostructures, and/or scaffolds. In some embodiments, microstructures may be provided that may become an analysis mechanism in a vessel. Capture reagents (which may include capture structures formed by the assay unit material) may allow cells to be tethered, bound, and/or trapped.[00450]    The capture reagents may immobilize a reactant, such as a cell, during processing. Capture techniques may be chemical, physical, electrical, magnetic, mechanical, size-related, density-related, or any combination thereof. In some embodiments, the capture reagents may be used to concentrate reactants, such as cells, at a desired location. For example, an assay unit may be coated with the capture reagents, which may cause cells to be captured at the assay unit surface, thus concentrating the cells on the captured surface. The capture reagents may keep the captured reactant immobilized on the cell surface. This may aid in keeping the reactants (e.g., cells, analytes) stationary during imaging.[00451]    Immobilizing the reactants may be useful for applications where there may be long acquisition times for reactions and/or detection. For example, a number of imaging applications may require extended exposure times (-1 min) or imaging of small objects (<1um) which may have significant Brownian motion.   ;A 028251962013-07-18 [00452]    In some embodiments, the capture reagents may be formed from materials that may provide little or no background for imaging. In some instances, the material of the assay unit may provide little or no background for imaging. The capture reagents may be selected so that they do not interfere with, or only have a small interference with, imaging and/or detection.[00453]    A reactant immobilized at the capture surface can be anything useful for detecting an analyte of interest in a sample of bodily fluid. For instance, such reactants include, without limitation, nucleic acid probes, antibodies, cell membrane receptors, monoclonal antibodies, antisera, and aptamers reactive with a specific analyte. Various commercially available reactants such as a host of polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies specifically developed for specific analytes can be used.[00454]    One skilled in the art will appreciate that there are many ways of immobilizing various reactants onto a support where reaction can take place. The immobilization may be covalent or noncovalent, via a linker moiety, or tethering them to an immobilized moiety. Non-limiting exemplary binding moieties for attaching either nucleic acids or proteinaceous molecules such as antibodies to a solid support include streptavidin or avidin/biotin linkages, carbamate linkages, ester linkages, amide, thiolester, (N)-functionalized thiourea, functionalized maleimide, amino, disulfide, amide, hydrazone linkages, and among others. In addition, a silyl moiety can be attached to a nucleic acid directly to a substrate such as glass using methods known in the art. Surface immobilization can also be achieved via a Poly-L Lysine tether, which provides a charge-charge coupling to the surface.[00455]    The assay units can be dried following the last step of incorporating a capture surface. For example, drying can be performed by passive exposure to a thy atmosphere or via the use of a vacuum manifold and/or application of clean dry air through a manifold or by lyophilization.[00456]    A capture surface may be applied to an assay unit using any technique. For example, the capture surface may be painted on, printed on, electrosprayed on, embedded in the material, impregnating the material, or any other technique. The capture reagents may be coated to the assay unit material, incorporated in the material, co-penetrate the material, or may be formed from the material. For example, a reagent, such as a capture reagent may be embedded in a polymer matrix that can be used as a sensor. In some embodiments, one or more small particles, such as a nanoparticle, a microparticic, and/or a bead, may be coated and/or impregnated with reagents. In some embodiments, the capture reagents may be part of the assay unit material itself, or may be something that is added to the material.[00457]    In many embodiments, an assay unit is designed to enable the unit to be manufactured in a high volume, rapid manufacturing processes. For example, tips can be mounted in large-scale arrays for batch coating of the capture surface into or onto the tip. In another example, tips can be placed into a moving belt or rotating table for serial processing. In yet another example, a large array of tips can be connected to vacuum and/or pressure manifolds for simple processing.[00458]    A capture reagent may be applied to an assay unit during any point in the process. For example, the capture reagent may be applied to the assay unit during manufacturing. The capture reagent may be applied to the assay unit prior to shipping the assay unit to a destination. Alternatively, the capture reagent may be applied to the assay unit after the assay unit has been shipped. In some instances, the capture reagent may be applied to the assay unit at a point of use, such as a point of service location.   ;A 028251962013.07-18 [00459]    In some embodiments, the capture reagent may cover an entire surface or region of the assay unit. The capture reagent may be provided on an inner surface of the assay unit. In some embodiments, the capture reagent may cover portions or sections of an assay unit surface. The capture reagent may be provided on a surface in a pattern. A unit may have portions of the surface that have a capture reagent applied thereon, and portions of the surface that do not have a capture reagent applied thereon. For example, there may be coated and non-coated regions. A capture reagent may be applied in a surface in accordance with a geometric choice of how the capture reagent is to be applied. For example, the capture reagent may be applied in dots, rows, columns, arrays, regions, circles, rings, or any other shape or pattern. The capture reagents may be applied at desired positions on the surface.[00460]    A plurality of capture reagents may optionally be applied to an assay unit. In some embodiments, the plurality of capture reagents may be applied so that the different capture reagents do not overlap (e.g., the different capture reagents are not applied to the same region or area). Alternatively, they may overlap (e.g., the different capture reagents may be applied to the same region or area). Space without any capture reagents may or may not be provided between regions with different capture reagents. The different capture reagents may be used to immobilize different reactants. For example, different capture reagents may be used to immobilize different cells and/or analytes on the capture surface. By using a plurality of capture reagents patterned in selected regions, a plurality of reactants may be detected from the same assay unit. In some embodiments, two OT more, three OT more, four OT more, five or more, seven or -MOW, ten OT more, fi fleet]. OT more, twenty OT more, thirty or more, forty or more, fifty or more, seventy or more, 100 or more, 150 or more, 200 or more, or 300 or more different capture reagents may be applied to a surface of an assay unit. The different capture reagents may be applied in any pattern or shape. For example, different capture reagents may be applied as an array or series of rings on an inner surface of an assay unit. For example, different capture reagents may be applied on an inner surface of a tip, vessel, container, cuvette, or any other container described elsewhere herein.[00461]    The location of the different capture reagents on the assay unit may be known prior to detection of the captured reactants. In some embodiments, the assay unit may have an identifier that may indicate the type of assay unit and/or the pattern of capture agents therein. Alternatively the location of the different capture reagents of the assay unit may not be known prior to detection of the captured reactants. The location of the different capture reagents may be determined based on detected patterns of captured reactants.[00462]    The capture reagents may be applied using any technique, such as those described elsewhere herein. In some instances, masking or lithographic techniques may be used to apply different capture reagents.[00463]    Any description herein of a capture reagent and/or coating applied to an assay unit may apply to any other units or containers described elsewhere herein, including but not limited to tips, vessels, cuvettes, or reagent units.[00464]    Reagent Assemblies [00465]    In many embodiments of the invention the reagent units are modular. The reagent unit can be designed to enable the unit to be manufactured in a high volume, rapid manufacturing processes. For example, many reagent units can be filled and sealed in a large-scale process simultaneously. The reagent units can be filled according to the type of assay or assays to be run by the device. For example, if one user desires different assays than another user, the reagent units can be manufactured accordingly to the preference of each user, ;A 028251962013-07-18 without the need to manufacture an entire device. In another example, reagent units can be placed into a moving belt or rotating table for serial processing.[00466]    In another embodiment, the reagent units are accommodated directly into cavities in the housing of a device. In this embodiment, a seal can be made onto areas of housing surrounding the units.[00467]    Reagents according to the present invention include without limitation wash buffers, enzyme substrates, dilution buffers, conjugates, enzyme-labeled conjugates, DNA amplifiers, sample diluents, wash solutions, sample pre-treatment reagents including additives such as detergents, polymers, chelating agents, albumin-binding reagents, enzyme inhibitors, enzymes, anticoagulants, red-cell agglutinating agents, antibodies, or other materials necessary to run an assay on a device. An enzyme-labeled conjugate can be either a polyclonal antibody or monoclonal antibody labeled with an enzyme that can yield a detectable signal upon reaction with an appropriate substrate. Non-limiting examples of such enzymes are alkaline phosphatase and horseradish peroxidase. In some embodiments, the reagents comprise immunoassay reagents. In general, reagents, especially those that are relatively unstable when mixed with liquid, are confined separately in a defined region (for example, a reagent unit) within the device.[00468]    In some embodiments, a reagent unit contains approximately about 5 microliters to about 1 milliliter of liquid. In some embodiments, the unit may contain about 20-200 microliters of liquid. In a further embodiment, the reagent unit contains 100 microliters of fluid. In an embodiment, a reagent unit contains about 40 microliters of fluid. The volume of liquid in a reagent unit may vary depending on the type of assay being run or the sample of bodily fluid provided. In an embodiment, the volumes of the reagents do not have to predetermined, but must be more than a known minimum. In some embodiments, the reagents arc initially stored dry and dissolved upon initiation of the assay being run on the device.[00469]    In an embodiment, the reagent units can be filled using a siphon, a funnel, a pipette, a syringe, a needle, or a combination thereof. The reagent units may be filled with liquid using a fill channel and a vacuum draw channel. The reagent units can be filled individually or as part of a bulk manufacturing process.[00470]    In an embodiment, an individual reagent unit comprises a different reagent as a means of isolating reagents from each other. The reagent units may also be used to contain a wash solution or a substrate. In addition, the reagent units may be used to contain a luminogenic substrate. In another embodiment, a plurality of reagents are contained within a reagent unit.[00471]    In some instances, the setup of the device enables the capability of pre-calibration of assay units and the reagent units prior to assembly of disposables of the subject device.[00472]    Aptamer binding assays [00473]    The subject invention enables a variety of assay methods based on the use of binding elements that specifically bind to one or more analytes in a sample. In general, a binding element is one member of a binding pair capable of specifically and selectively binding to the other member of the binding pair in the presence of a plurality of different molecules. Examples of binding elements include, but are not limited to, antibodies, antigens, metal-binding ligands, nucleic acid probes and primers, receptors and reactants as described herein, and aptamers. In some embodiments, a binding element used to detect an analyte is an aptamer. The term \"aptamer\" is used to refer to a peptide, nucleic acid, or a combination thereof that is selected for the ability to specifically bind One OT more target analytes. Peptide aptamers are affinity agents that generally comprise One OT more variable loop domains displayed on the surface of a scaffold protein. A nucleic acid aptamer is a specific ;A 028251962013-07-18 binding oligonucleotidc, which is an oligonucleotide that is capable of scicctively forming a complex with an intended target analyte. The complexation is target-specific in the sense that other materials, such as other analytes that may accompany the target analyte, do not complex to the aptamer with as great an affinity. It is recognized that complexation and affinity are a matter of degree; however, in this context, \"target-specific\" means that the aptamer binds to target with a much higher degree of affinity than it binds to contaminating materials. The meaning of specificity in this context is thus similar to the meaning of specificity as applied to antibodies, for example. The aptamer may be prepared by any known method, including synthetic, recombinant, and purification methods. Further, the term \"aptamer\" also includes \"secondary aptamers\" containing a consensus sequence derived from comparing two or more known aptamers to a given target.[00474]    In general, nucleic acid aptamers are about 9 to about 35 nucleotides in length. in some embodiments, a nucleic acid aptamer is at least 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 80, 90, 100, or more residues in length. Although the oligonucleotides of the aptamers generally are single-stranded or double-stranded, it is contemplated that aptamers may sometimes assume triple-stranded or quadruple-stranded structures. In sonic embodiments, a nucleic acid aptamer is circular, such as in US20050176940. The specific binding oligonucleotides of the aptamers should contain the sequence-conferring specificity, but may be extended with flanking regions and otherwise derivatized or modified. The aptamers found to bind to a target analyte may be isolated, sequenced, and then re-synthesized as conventional DNA or RNA moieties, or may be modified oligomers. These modifications include, but are not limited to incorporation of: (1) modified or analogous forms of sugars (e.g. ribose and deoxyribose); (2) alternative linking groups; or (3) analogous forms of purine and pyrimidine bases.[00475]    Nucleic acid aptamers can comprise DNA, RNA, functionalized or modified nucleic acid bases, nucleic acid analogues, modified or alternative backbone chemistries, or combinations thereof. The oligonucleotides of the aptamers may contain the conventional bases adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine or uridine. Included within the term aptamers are synthetic aptamers that incorporate analogous forms of purines and pyrimidines. \"Analogous\" forms of purines and pyrimidines are those generally known in the art, many of which are used as chemotherapeutic agents. Non-limiting examples of analogous forms of purines and pyrimidines (i.e. base analogues) include aziridinylcytosine, 4-acetylcytosine, 5-fluorouracil, 5-bromouracil, 5-carboxymethylaminomethy1-2-thiouracil, 5-carboxymethyl-aminomethyluracil, inosine, N6-isopentenyladenine, 1-methyladenine, 1-methylpseudouracil, 1-methylguanine, 1-methylinosine, 2,2-dimethylguanine, 2-mcthyladcnine, 2-Incthylguaninc, 3-methylcytosinc, 5-methylcytosine, N6-methyladeninc, 7-mcthylguanine, 5-methylaminomethyl-uracil, 5-methoxyaminomethy1-2-thiouracil, beta-D-mannosylqueosine, 5-methoxyuracil, 2-methyl-thio-N6-isopentenyladenine, uracil-5-oxyacetic acid methylester, pseudouracil, queosine, 2-thiocytosine, 5-methyl-2-thiouracil, 2-thiouracil, 4-thiouracil, 5-methyluracil, uracil-5-oxyacetic acid, 5-pentynyl-uracil, and 2,6-diaminopurine. The use of uracil as a substitute base for thymine in deoxyribonucleic acid (hereinafter referred to as \"dU\") is considered to be an \"analogous\" form of pyrimidine in this invention.[00476]    Aptamer oligonucleotides may contain analogous forms of ribose or deoxyribose sugars that are known in the art, including but not limited to 2' substituted sugars such as 2'-0-methyl-, 2'-0-allyl, 2'-fluoro- or 2'-azido-ribose, carbocyclic sugar analogs, alpha-anomcric sugars, epimeric sugars such as arabinose, xyloscs or lyxoses, pyranose sugars, furanose sugars, sedoheptuloses, locked nucleic acids (LNA), peptide nucleic acid (PNA), acyclic analogs and abasic nucleoside analogs such as methyl riboside.   1004771    Aptamers may also include intermediates in their synthesis. For example, any of the hydroxyl groups ordinarily present may be replaced by phosphonate groups, phosphate groups, protected by a standard protecting group, or activated to prepare additional linkages to additional nucleotides or substrates. The 5' terminal OH is conventionally free but may be phosphorylated; OH substituents at the 3 terminus may also be phosphorylated. The hydroxyls may also be derivatized to standard protecting groups. One or more phosphodiester linkages may be replaced by alternative linking groups. These alternative linking groups include, but are not limited to embodiments wherein P(0)0 is replaced by P(0)S (\"thioate\"), P(S)S (\"dithioate\"), P(0)NR 2 (\"amidate\"), P(0)R, P(0)OR', CO or CH 2 (\"formacetar), wherein each R or R' is independently H or substituted or unsubstituted alkyl (1-20C.) optionally containing an ether (-0----) linkage, aryl, alkenyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl or aralkyl.1004781    One particular embodiment of aptamers that are useful in the present invention is based on RNA aptamers as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,270,163 and 5,475,096.The aforementioned patents disclose the SELEX method, which involves selection from a mixture of candidate oligonucleotides and stepwise iterations of binding, partitioning and amplification, using the same general selection scheme, to achieve virtually any desired criterion of binding affinity and selectivity. Starting from a mixture of nucleic acids, preferably comprising a segment of randomized sequence, the SELEX method includes steps of contacting the mixture with a target, such as a target analyte, under conditions favorable for binding, partitioning unbound nucleic acids from those nucleic acids which have bound specifically to target molecules, dissociating the nucleic acid-target complexes, amplifying the nucleic acids dissociated from the nucleic acid-target complexes to yield a ligand-enriched mixture of nucleic acids, then reiterating the steps of binding, partitioning, dissociating and amplifying through as many cycles as desired to yield highly specific, high affinity nucleic acid ligands to the target molecule. In some embodiments, negative screening is employed in which a plurality of aptamers are exposed to analytes or other materials likely to be found together with target analytcs in a sample to be analyzed, and only aptamers that do not bind are retained.1004791    The SELEX method encompasses the identification of high-affinity nucleic acid ligands containing modified nucleotides conferring improved characteristics on the ligand, such as improved in vivo stability or improved delivery characteristics. Examples of such modifications include chemical substitutions at the ribose and/or phosphate and/or base positions. In some embodiments, two or more aptamers are joined to form a multivalent aptamer molecule. Multivalent aptamer molecules can comprise multiple copies of an aptamer, each copy targeting the same analyte, two or more different aptamers targeting different analytes, or combinations of these.[00480]    Aptamers can be used as diagnostic and prognostic reagents, as reagents for the discovery of novel therapeutics, as reagents for monitoring drug response in individuals, and as reagents for the discovery of novel therapeutic targets. Aptamers can be used to detect, modify the function of, or interfere with or inhibit the flinction of one or more target analytes. The term \"analytes\" as used herein includes without limitation drugs, prodrugs, pharmaceutical agents, drug metabolites, biomarkers such as expressed proteins and cell markers, antibodies, serum proteins, cholesterol and other metabolites, electrolytes, metal ions, polysaccharides, nucleic acids, biological analytes, biomarkers, genes, proteins, hormones, or any combination thereof. Analytes can be combinations of polypeptides, glycoproteins, polysaccharides, lipids, and nucleic acids. Aptamers can inhibit the function of gene products by any one of, but not limited to only, the following mechanisms: (i) modulating ;A 028251962013-07-18 thc affinity of a protein-protein interaction; (ii) modulating thc expression of a protcin on a transcriptional level; (iii) modulating the expression of a protein on a post-transcriptional level; (iv) modulating the activity of a protein; and (v) modulating the location of a protein. The precise mechanism of action of peptide aptamers can be determined by biochemical and genetic means to ascertain their specific function in the context of their interaction with other genes, and gene products.[00481]    Aptamers can be used to detect an analyte in any of the detection schemes described herein. In one embodiment, apatamers are covalently or non-covalently coupled to a substrate. Non-limiting examples of substrates to which aptamers may be coupled include microarrays, microbeads, pipette tips, sample transfer devices, cuvettes, capillary or other tubes, reaction chambers, or any other suitable format compatible with the subject detection system. Biochip microan-ay production can employ various semiconductor fabrication techniques, such as solid phase chemistry, combinatorial chemistry, molecular biology, and robotics. One process typically used is a photolithographic manufacturing process for producing microarrays with millions of probes on a single chip. Alternatively, if the probes are pre-synthesized, they can be attached to an array surface using techniques such as micro-channel pumping, \"ink-jet\" spotting, template-stamping, or photocrosslinking. An exemplary photolithographic process begins by coating a quartz wafer with a light-sensitive chemical compound to prevent coupling between the quartz wafer and the first nucleotide of the DNA probe being created. A lithographic mask is used to either inhibit or permit the transmission of light onto specific locations of the wafer surface. The surface is then contacted with a solution which may contain adenine, thymine, cytosine, or guanine, and coupling occurs only in those regions on the glass that have been deprotected through illumination. The coupled nucleotide bears a light-sensitive protecting group, allowing the cycle can be repeated. In this manner, the microarray is created as the probes are synthesized via repeated cycles of deprotection and coupling. The process may be repeated until the probes reach their full length. Commercially available arrays are typically manufactured at a density of over 1.3 million unique features per array.Depending on the demands of the experiment and the number of probes required per array, each wafer, can be cut into tens or hundreds of individual arrays.[00482]    Other methods may be used to produce the biochip. The biochip may be a Langmuir-Bodgett film, functional ized glass, germanium, silicon, PTFE, polystyrene, gallium arsenide, gold, silver, membrane, nylon, PVP, or any other material known in the art that is capable of having functional groups such as amino, carboxyl, Diels-Alder reactants, thiol or hydroxyl incorporated on its surface. These groups may then be covalently attached to crosslinking agents, so that the subsequent attachment of the nucleic acid ligands and their interaction with target molecules will occur in solution without hindrance from the biochip. Typical crosslinking groups include ethylene glycol oligomer, diamines, and amino acids. Alternatively, aptamers may be coupled to an array using enzymatic procedures, such as described in US20100240544.[00483]    In some embodiments, aptamers are coupled to the surface of a microbead. Microbeads useful in coupling to oligonucleotides are known in the art, and include magnetic, magnetizable, and non-magnetic beads. Microbeads can be labeled with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or more dyes to facilitate coding of the beads and identification of an aptamer joined thereto. Coding of microbeads can be used to distinguish at least 10, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000, 1500, 2000, 5000, or more different microbeads in a single assay, each microbead corresponding to a different aptamer with specificity for a different analyte. ;A 028251962013.07-18 [00484]    In some embodiments, reagents are coupled to the surface of a reaction chamber, such as a tip. For example, the interior surface of a tip may be coated with an aptamer specific for a single analyte. Alternatively, the interior surface of a tip may be coated with two or more different aptamers specific for different analytes. When two or more different aptamers are coupled to the same interior tip surface, each of the different aptamers may be coupled at different known locations, such as forming distinct ordered rings or bands at different positions along the axis of a tip. In this case, multiple different analytes may be analyzed in the same sample by drawing a sample up a tip and allowing analytes contained in the sample to bind with the aptamers coated at successive positions along the tip. Binding events can then be visualized as described herein, with the location of each band in a banding pattern corresponding to a specific known analyte.[00485]    In some embodiments, binding of one or more aptamers to one or more target analytes is detected using an optical feature. In some embodiments, the optical feature is fluorescence. In some embodiments, a sample containing analytes to be analyzed is treated with a labeling compound to conjugate the analytes with a fluorescent tag. Binding can then be measured by fluorescence to detect presence and optionally quantity of one or more analytes, such as illustrated in Figure 136 in combination with aptamers coupled to an array, and in Figure 137 in combination with aptamers coupled to coded beads. In some embodiments, the sample is treated with a labeling compound to conjugate the analytes with a linker. Upon binding the linker is functionalized with a fluorescent tag and the positive event is measured by fluorescence. In some embodiments, the analyte binding domain of an aptamer is partially hybridized to a complentary probe that is fluorescently labeled. Upon binding to the analyte, the complementary probe is released, which results in an optically measurable decrease in fluorescent signal. In some embodiments, an aptamer is fluorescently labeled and is partially hybridized to a complementary probe labeled with a quencher that is in proximity to the fluorescent label. Upon binding to the analyte, the complementary probe is released resulting in a measurable increase in fluorescence of the label conjugated to the aptamer. In some embodiments, the aptamer is partially hybridized to a complementary probe, which hybridization occludes a domain containing a secondary structure. Upon binding to the analyte, the complementary probe is released, and the secondary structure is made available to an intercalating dye used to produce a measurable signal. Labels useful in the detection of binding between an apatamer and an analyte in a binding pair can include, for example, fluorescein, tetramethylrnodamine, Texas Red, or any other fluorescent molecule known in the art. The level of label detected at each address on the biochip will then vary with the amount of target analyte in the mixture being assayed.[00486]    In some embodiments, the displaced complementary probe is conjugated to one member of an affinity pair, such as biotin. A detectable molecule is then conjugated to the other member of the affinity pair, for example avidin. After the test mixture is applied to the biochip, the conjugated detectable molecule is added. The amount of detectable molecule at each site on the biochip will vary inversely with the amount of target molecule present in the test mixture. In another embodiment, the displaced complementary probe will be biotin labeled, and can be detected by addition of fluorescently labeled avidin; the avidin itself will then be linked to another fluorescently labeled, biotin-conjugated compound. The biotin group on the displaced oligonucleotide can also be used to bind an avidin-linked reporter enzyme; the enzyme will then catalyze a reaction leading to the deposition of a detectable compound. Alternatively, the reporter enzyme will catalyze the production of an insoluble product that will locally quench the fluorescence of an intrinsically-fluorescent biochip. In another embodiment of the displacement assay, the displaced complementary probe will be labeled with an ;A 028251962013-07-18 immunologically-detectable probe, such as digoxigcnin. The displaced complementary probe will thcn be bound by a first set of antibodies that specifically recognize the probe. These first antibodies will then be recognized and bound by a second set of antibodies that are fluorescently labeled or conjugated to a reporter enzyme. Many variations on these examples are known or will now occur to those skilled in the art. Assays analogous to \"double-sandwich\" ELISAs can also be set up using combinations of antibodies and aptamcrs as receptors. For example, a capture surface can be functionalized with an aptamer and the detection reagent can be an enzyme-labeled antibody. Conversely, the antibody can be on the capture surface and the detection reagent a labeled aptamer.[00487]    In some embodiments, a sample containing an anlalyte to be analyzed is dispersed into a three-dimensional hydrogel matrix. The hydrogel matrix can be activated to covalenly trap proteins and small molecules. After a wash of the excess and unbound sample, fluorescently labeled aptamers can be introduced for the detection of the specific analytes present, such as illustrated in Figure 138. In some embodiments, the three-dimensional hydrogel matrix is divided in small subsets or microwclls to which a single aptamer can be added to undergo a specific analysis of the analyte present. In some embodiments, aptamers are labeled with a set of coded quantum dots or fluorescent tags corresponding to a unique signature. In some embodiments, labeled aptamers are added to the three-dimensional matrix simultaneously with the sample.[00488]    In some embodiments, an aptamer is used instead of an antibody in an ELISA assay. In general, a sample is exposed to a surface and specifically or non-specifically coupled thereto. In a sandwich ELTSA, an analyte is specifically coupled to a surface by binding to first antibody that is coupled to the surface. In a typical ELISA, the analyte, whether bound specifically or non-specifically, is then detected by binding to a second antibody carrying a label. In an aptamer ELISA, the first antibody, second antibody, or both are replaced with aptamers specific for an analyte.[00489]    Imauinu Analysis of Samples and Assay Reaction Products [00490]    In some embodiments of the invention, analysis of sample and the assay reaction products can be performed using digital imaging. The assay cuvettes can be aligned for measurement and scanned or imaged in a single operation. In the instrumented system of the invention this is achieved automatically by mechanical components. Assay cuvettes are located at defined locations in a cartridge and moved to the scanner maintaining the same orientation and spacing. The graph shown in Figure 92 corresponds to the green channel response over the width of the cuvette. As shown, the edges of the cuvettes are well-defined, as is the location corresponding to the middle of the cuvette.[00491]    The images obtained by scanning or imaging can be a two-dimensional array of pixels, where each pixel comprises a plurality of intensity values corresponding to a distinct detection spectral region (e.g., red, blue, green). The images can be interpreted by line-scans, which may correspond to a horizontal portion of a tip. If the tip is circular-shaped, then an effective absorbance can be determined by deconvoluting the line-scan over an appropriate function. Example functions include parabolic functions, and functions for circles. In some embodiments, the images can be data-averaged over multiple images taken of a tip or a sample over a range of physical locations.[00492]    In an embodiment, a sensor is provided to locate an assay unit relative to a detector when an assay is detected.   ;A 028251962013-07-18 [00493]    As shown in Figure 61 and Figure 62, bromophenol blue solutions were aspirated into a set of conical tips and imaged with front face illumination (light source and detector on the same side of the object). Small volumes (5 uL) of serial dilutions of a 0.78 mg/mL solution were used with the highest concentration at the top of the image. In Figure 61, tips on the left have the sample located at the widest location in the conical tip whereas tips on the right have the sample at the narrowest. The image in Figure 61 was taken using a scanning optical system.[00494]    Figure 62 shows tips that were imaged using a back-lit configuration (light source and detector on opposite sides of the imaged object). The back-lit configuration can be preferred because of the higher image quality.[00495]    As shown in Figure 61 and Figure 62, the effective optical path length of a colored solution can be varied by changing tip design. In particular, the pathlength can be varied within a single tip to increase sensitivity of measurement of light absorbance (long pathlength) or to increase the dynamic range of the measurement. The pathlength can be changed, for example, by changing the diameter of the tip.[00496]    An additional feature of the tip design can be that it enables assays to be read with a very small volume of assay reaction product requiring a very small volume of sample. Typically, assay reaction mixtures are incubated in a narrow part of a tip which provides a high ratio of liquid/air surface area to volume, thus minimizing evaporation. The small volume can then be moved to a wide part of the tip for measurement of the colored product thus maximizing the optical pathlength available (and thereby increasing the absorbance of light) for a given reaction mixture volume.[00497]    For example in the table below, we compare reading an assay reaction mixture of 10 uL in which a 1 uL sample is diluted 1:10. In the tips of the current invention, incubation of an assay mixture can be achieved in a 13 mm length of tip region having a diameter of 1 mm then be moved to a 3 mm diameter region for color measurement. In comparison with using a microliter plate of standard dimensions (typical of 384-well plates) to incubate and read the same assay, the area of liquid surface exposed to air (allowing evaporation) is about 5 times less and the optical pathlength is about twice as great.Sample volume         1.00 uLDilution factor       10.00 fold Reaction volume       10.00 uLTips Tip diameter          1.00 mm     For incubation Exposed surface area    1.57 mmA2    For incubation Length of liquid column           12.73 mm    For incubation Tip diameter          3.00        Pathlength for reading Length of liquid column           1.41 mm    For reading Microtiter Plate Well diameter         3.00 mm ;A 028251962013-07-18 Exposed surface area    7.07 mmA2 Length of liquid column           1.41 mm    Pathlength [00498]    Optimizing optical path length [00499]    Spectroscopic measurements of colored solutes are traditionally measured by recording the fraction of light transmitted through a cuvette at the absorbance wavelength maximum. The data are then transformed to give Absorbance (A) or optical density (OD) values. According to Beer's law, A(kmax) = cM*1*Concentration where cM is the molar extinction product (L/Mole.cm), 1 is the optical pathlength (cm) and Concentration is in molar units. OD = A for 1= 1. This is done to provide a measure, A, which is directly proportional to solute concentration.[00500]    There are two significant limitations of absorbance measurements for assaying solute concentrations. At low concentrations, the change in transmission is small and therefore imprecise because of variations in the background (or blank) transmission. At high concentrations transmission is very low (for example at A = 3, the transmitted light is 1/1000 th of the input light. Any \"stray\" light or other forms of signal noise have a significant effect on the measurement and the response to concentration becomes non-linear and imprecise. Typically, absorbance measurements are regarded as precise and accurate over a range from about 0.1 to about 2.0 (a 20-fold range).[00501]    The method of the present invention overcomes these problems to a significant degree by enabling facile measurements of color over a very wide dynamic range (up to 1000-fold):[00502]    1.    At different pathlengths: low concentrations can be measured at long pathlengths and high concentrations at short pathlengths.[00503]    2.    In different color channels: low concentrations can be measured in the best matching color channel and high concentrations in color channels mismatched to the color.[00504]    This is illustrated by the data shown in Figure 79. Bromphenol blue solutions serially diluted from a 5 mg/mL stock were analyzed using the three-color method in tips at two locations, one with a maximum pathlength (also \"path length\" herein) of about 5 mm (\"wide\"), the other of about 1 mm (\"narrow\"). Signals in the three color channels were normalized to their highest and lowest levels as shown in the graph below. An algorithm to optimally extract the concentration of the analyte (bromphenol blue) was set up as follows:[00505]    1.    For normalized signals in the range 10% maximum < signal < 90% maximum, compute a value concentration = a + b*Log(signal) + c*(Log(signal))^2 where a b and c are arbitrary constants. This operation was performed for each color at both pathlengths.[00506]    2.    Using a well-known optimization routine (for example \"Solver\" in Microsoft Excel), compute the best-fit values of a, b and c for all colors and pathlengths.[00507]    3.    Average the computed concentration values for all colors and both pathlengths.[00508]    As shown in Figure 80, the method yielded accurate results across a 1000-fold concentration range. When the algorithm was used to compute concentration values for replicate measurements (N = 3), the average CV was 3.5 Vo.   ;A 028251962013-07-18 [00509]    Measurements can be made at various patblengths. In some cases, pathlengtlis are at least partially dependent on container (e.g., cuvette, tip, vial) geometry. The container geometry and/or features in the container, such as scattering features, may affect the optical path and path length in the container.[00510]    Multi-color analysis [00511]    Scanners and cameras have detectors that can measure a plurality of different colors channel detection spectrum regions (e.g., red, green, and blue). Because the spectral width of each of these channels is wide and color chemistries produce colored products with wide band widths, colored reaction products can be detected using a plurality of channel detection spectrums. For example, Figure 71 shows the response of red (squares), green (diamonds), and blue (triangles) detection channel spectrums as a function of analyte concentration. The signals produced by each detector correspond to light intensity within each detection spectrum and arc typically expressed as a number from 0 to 255. When white light is transmitted through a circular section cuvette containing a colored solute as shown above, light is absorbed and the light intensity reduced so that the detector responses change.[00512]    For example, when bromophenol blue dissolved in alkaline buffer at concentrations ranging from 0 to 5 mg/mL and scanned at the location indicated \"C3\" in Figure 62, signals shown in Figure 66, which are the detector responses averaged over a zone corresponding to seven pixels along the length of the cuvette. The signals were recorded on an Epson backlit scanner. Figure 66 shows the three color responses for a set of 11 cuvettes containing 2-fold serial dilutions of a 5 mg/mL bromophenol blue solution and a \"blank\" solution (arranged left to right on the image). The image of the scanned tips is shown in Figure 67. The signal in each channel corresponding to the solution is reduced to an extent related to the optical path. Accordingly, the maximum change in signal is seen at the center of the cuvette. When signals in the central region of the cuvette were averaged (over the zone shown by the small rectangles for the fourth cuvette from the left) and plotted against the bromophenol blue concentration, the dose-responses shown Figure 68 were observed. In each color \"channel\" the signal declined smoothly with concentration. The green signal changed most and the blue signal least. Corresponding optical densities measured in an MS spectrometer (Molecular Devices) at the wavelength of maximal absorbance (e.g., 589 nm) are also shown. At the highest concentrations, the spectrophotometer response becomes not linear and changes very little with concentration. A similar effect was noted in the scanner green and red channel responses. The blue channel response in contrast, is very slight until the highest concentrations.[00513]    According to Beer's law, absorbance of a solution is equal to 8M*Concentration*pathlength. Absorbance is defined as LoglO(Transmission/Blank Transmission), where blank transmission is that corresponding to that for the solvent. Strictly Beer's law applies to a parallel beam of monochromatic light (in practice a band width of a few nm) passing normally through a rectangular cuvette. Spectrophotometers respond linearly to concentration up to Absorbance values about 1.5. At higher absorbance, instrument response becomes non-linear due to \"stray light\" and other effects. Optical density is defined as absorbance for a one cm optical pathlength.[00514]    When the color signal data from the above experiment was transformed according to an expression that linearizes optical transmission so as to obtain an absorbance value proportional to concentration in conventional spectrophotomctry (-Log(signal/blank signal), the graph shown in Figure 69 was obtained for the green (squares) and red (diamonds) channels.   ;A 028251962013-07-18 [00515]    The green channel data followed Beer's law but the red channel data did not reaching a plateau level at for a sample having about 2 mg/mL in a fashion similar to that of the OD response of the spectrophotometer.[00516]    Improved assay utilization by three-color analysis and optimization of optical path length [00517]    Assay results from reaction setups that would otherwise provide uninterpretable data can be salvaged using the present invention. The present invention allows for increased dynamic range and sensitivity of assays by the combination of optical pathlength optimization and three-color analysis. The inability to salvage data plagued by reduced dynamic range is a major problem in assay management, especially in the context of samples being evaluated for diagnostic or therapy management purposes is that assays have a limited dynamic range or limited range of analyte values that can be reported with good confidence. There are two main reasons why an assay result may not be available from laboratory-based assay systems or from distributed test situations. Namely the analyte value is too high or too low to be reported. This may in some circumstances be rectified in clinical laboratories by re-analyzing a portion of a retained sample using a different dilution. In distributed testing typically there is no recourse but to recall the patient, obtain a new sample and use a different (laboratory) method. This is because assay systems use fixed protocols and fixed levels of sample dilution. In either situation, it is very inconvenient and expensive to rectify the problem. Moreover, valuable information pertinent to proper diagnosis and/or therapy management may be lost with resultant halm to the patient.[00518]    In the system of the present invention, these problems are eliminated by monitoring assays during their execution, recognizing any problem and modifying either the optical pathlength used to measure the assay product or making use of the different sensitivity levels of the three color channels to the assay color and in turn to the analyte sensitivity.[00519]    Specifically when the assay reaction product is measured if the measured signal is either too high or too low, the system can respond by:[00520]    1. making the measurement with a different pathlength (moving the optical cuvette relative to the optical system such that the pathlength is either bigger or smaller). This can be performed by (a) making a measurement at a standard, first location, (b) reporting the result to the software managing the assay (in instrument and/or on a remote server), (c) recognizing a problem condition, and (d) modifying the read position and making a second measurement; and/or [00521]    2. emphasizing a more or less sensitive color channel in signal analysis. This can be implemented automatically by suitable assay analysis algorithms.[00522]    Color Calibration [00523]    The signal responses can be calibrated to allow for computation of the concentration of the colored species from imaging data. To obtain a data transform predictive of the concentration of the colored solute, the following procedure can be used. In other embodiments, other methods may also be used.[00524]    1. For each channel for all concentrations, the transform -Log(signal/blank signal) was computed and designated \"A\".[00525]    2. For all concentrations, a further transform (\"C\") was computed as a*A b*AA2 c*AA3 (initially values for a, b and c were set at arbitrary values).[00526]    3. For all concentrations, C values for the three color channels were summed and designated Cestimate.   ;A 028251962013-07-18 [00527]    4. The stun of square differences between the target (known) concentration and Cestimate was computed over all concentrations.[00528]    5. Values of a, b and c parameters for all channels were derived by a well-known algorithm which minimized the sum of the square differences.[00529]    The results shown in Figure 70 demonstrates accurate calibration of the scanner response over the entire concentration range.[00530]    Other automated calibration algorithms have been developed and found to be equally effective. For example, the following is an example of calibration for a cholesterol assay performed in a reaction tip.[00531]    The measured signal is decomposed into Red (R), Green (G), and Blue (B) color channels. Calibration equations are computed to optimize the accuracy, precision, and dynamic range according to assay design requirements.[00532]    In this assay example, only Red and Green channels are utilized to compute concentration. These two signals are transformed to compute an intermediate variable (F) as follows:[00533]    F = pi+ p2= G + p3 =G2 + p4 = R + p5 = R2 [00534]    where pi are calibration parameters.[00535]    Finally, the signal F is used to compute the concentration (C) via a linear transformation:[00536] c (FP7' [00537]    where C is the calculated concentration, and p6 and p7 are calibration parameters, in this case, representing the intercept and slope parameters of a linear relationship, respectively.[00538]    When the same approach was followed for a large set of assays for a variety of analytes which produced colored products spanning the entire visible spectrum (kmax from 400 -700 nm), comparable results were obtained.[00539]    In conventional transmission spectrophotometric measurements, a \"blank\" value is used to normalize the measurement. Method (1) Blanks are typically constructed by measuring a sample that is equivalent to the sample but does not have any of the component to be measured. The measurement is typically made in the same cuvette as that which will be used for the sample or an optically equivalent cuvette. Thus in a spectrophotometric assay, one would combine all the reagents in the same concentrations using the same protocol substituting a zero analyte solution for the sample. Method (2) uses a two step process making measurements against an absolute reference such as air (which will never vary in absorbance) and measuring both sample and blank against the absolute reference. The sample absorbance is then calculated by subtraction of the blank value from that of the sample. Method (3) is to collect spectra of the sample or assay reaction product and reference the measured absorbance (or transmission) at an optimal wavelength (usually that for maximum absorbance for the measured species) against the absorbance at a wavelength where the species to be measured is known to have zero absorbance. The absorbance is the difference between those recorded at the two wavelengths.[00540]    Digital imaging and three-color analysis can be employed, but in some embodiments can be modified according to the digital (pixilated) character of the assay signal. Namely:   ;A 028251962013.07-18 [00541]    1. For each pixel in the image and for each color a white standard is imaged and the intensities of the signal adjusted to a value corresponding to no absorbance. This can be done by the following exemplary procedure:[00542]    a. adjusting the intensity of the light source [00543]    b. adjusting the sensitivity of the detector (preferred), or [00544]    c. software adjustment (not preferred by itself) [00545]    A preferred approach is a combination of (b) and (c) above. First, adjust the detector in the analog realm, and then fine tune the result in the digital realm.[00546]    For the analog adjustment, the gain and offset of the amplifiers between the light sensors and the analog-to-digital section are adjusted to ensure maximum resolution of the digitization. The lower end of the light range of interest will be set to zero and the high end of the range will be set to just below saturation of the sensor.[00547]    Subsequently, the images may be fine-timed in the digital domain. A preferred approach, specifically, would be to use what is called the \"two-image calibration\" for an m x n image. The mechanism is to first collect a black image by blocking all light to the detector. We'll call this image BLACK[m,n]. A second calibration image is recorded consisting of light at the maximum end of the sensitivity range. We'll call this image WHITE[m,n]. Thus a corrected image a[m,n] could be constructed, pixel-wise, as:c [in , n] ¨ B LA C K[m, n][00548]    a[m, n] = _______________ WHITS?, n]¨ BL A C K[m , n][00549]    Note that this digital correction does not improve the dynamic range of the digitized data, but adjusts the values so that the full white and black references are consistent.[00550]    2. An image of a physical blank in a tip can be used as a pixel-by-pixel and color by color blank. The blank can be:[00551]    a. Air;[00552]    b. Water;[00553]    c. Blank assay reaction product (no analyte);[00554]    d. Sample blank (no assay reagents); or [00555]    e. Some combination of the above;[00556]    3. The signal from a color channel where there is a zero or weak response can be used to normalize signals from the other channels.[00557]    A further method of controlling and normalizing the optics is to image a set of physical (stable) standards before or during an assay. For example, an array of printed dyes (shown in Figure 104) can be made corresponding to a set of standard colors with standard intensities (similar to standard color \"wheels\" used to calibrate cameras and scanners).[00558]    Such standards may be measured using reflectance from an opaque surface or (preferred) by transmission through a clear film.[00559]    Depending on the stability of the optics, calibration and normalization of the optics may be (1) a one-time exercise, (2) performed at regular intervals or (3) performed for each assay.[00560]    Calibrating a digital imager range ;A 028251962013-07-18 [00561]    In some embodiments, methods may be provided for calibrating a digital imager used for imaging optical densities.[00562]    In testing the optical density of an analyte, it maybe desirable to make use of as much of the dynamic range of the imager as possible. Under normal use, the setup may comprise a relatively homogenous illuminated white background, the imager and the analyte to be tested in a transparent cuvette between them. Operationally, the test may comprise placing the cuvette between the imager and the white backlight source and measure the amount of light absorbed by the analyte in the cuvette. To maximize the full dynamic range of the sensor, the background may be sensed as the maximum intensity measurable. It may be desirable to take care to not saturate the sensor because then information could be lost since when the sensor is saturated, and attenuation may not be correctly measured. The system may be configured to efficiently maximize the measured values of the backlight while minimizing number of saturated pixels.[00563]    The illuminated background may emit white light of equal intensity over its entire surface. The light output may vary somewhat, producing a normal distribution of pixel intensities as detected by the imager. This is illustrated by the curves shown in Figure 128. For this example, the sensor may return a value from 0 to 256 from each pixel as an indicator of the amount of light it receives. Each pixel may saturate at a value of 256. That is, regardless of further increasing of light intensity or sensor sensitivity, only a value of 256 may be recorded. Series 1 in Figure 128, the dotted line, shows where the light is too intense, cutting off the normal curve. Series 3, the dashed line, shows that all pixels are correctly reading intensity, but that the imager sensitivity is lower than it might be for maximum dynamic range. The majority of the pixels are at a value of less than 200. Series 2 represents the desired settings, where the mean of the distribution is as high as possible, but that a sufficiently small number of pixels are saturated.[00564]    In one embodiment, the intensity of the backlight may be held constant while the imager's settings may be adjusted. For the purpose of imager sensitivity, two controls may be used: exposure time and gain. Exposure time may be the amount of time that the sensor pixels are permitted to collect photons before the value is read out. For a given amount of light, the readout value may be larger when the exposure time is made longer. This control may be the \"coarse\" control for the application. Gain may be the control adjusting the amount of amplification applied to the sensor signal. Increasing gain may increase the value of the signal from the sensor. Gain may be the \"fine\" control.[00565]    An exemplary procedure for setting the imager's sensitivity parameters may include one or more of the following steps:1.    Set exposure time to value known to be below saturation. Set gain to highest usable value.2. Binary search starting upwards adjust exposure time to find the setting where not all of the pixels in the region of interest of the image are saturated. This may be detected by observing the point at which the mean pixel value becomes less than 256.3. Back gain down incrementally until there are sufficiently few pixels that are at the saturation limit. The number of pixels at an acceptable level will be determined by the shape of the distribution. Wide standard deviation will increase the number of pixels permitted to be saturated.[00566]    Next, the white balance may be corrected. There are three groups of sensors in a digital imager. Members of each group collect light of a different wavelength, red, green or blue. When detecting white light, the sensors would preferably see equal values or red, green and blue. The white balance control adjusts the ;A 028251962013.07-18 relative gains of the red and blue channel. Sincc the light coming from the backlight is defined as white, the procedure would be to simply adjust the white balance until the channels read the same values. In practice, the green channel is typically left unadjusted, and the red and blue channels are changed in opposite directions to each other as the control is changed. However, in other embodiments, another channel, such as the red channel or blue channel may be left unadjusted while the other two channels may be changed.[00567]    Finally, the images may be fine-tuned in the digital domain. A preferable approach, specifically, would be to use what is called the \"two-image calibration\" for an m x n image, as previously described.[00568]    Assays making a variety of colored products have been analyzed in the subject invention. Colors from those with low wavelength absorption maxima (yellow) to high wavelength maxima (blue) have been successfully measured. Wavelength maxima for some representative assays were: 405, 450, 500, 510, 540, 570, 612 and 620 nm demonstrating the ability to read color over the entire visible spectrum.[00569]    Colors may be quantified using average data for many pixels (typically about 1000). A parameter (f) which produces a good fit (e.g., greatest R2) to the dose-response data may be selected. The parameter may be first fitted to the form al +bl*R+cl*R2+b2*G+c2*G2+b3*B+c2*B2 where a, b, c are constants and R, G and B are color intensity values for red, green and blue channels respectively. The parameter f may then be derived by forcing it to have a maximum value of 1 and a minimum value of 0. Parameter f is related to transmission of light through the colored reaction product. As would be expected, f may be closely related to the parameter optical density (OD) used in spectrophotometry to quantify an absorbing species. When 1 - f measured by 3-color imaging is plotted against OD measured at the absorption maximum for the same assay reaction products in a microtherplate in a spectrophotometer, it may be observed that 1 ¨ f is essentially linearly related to OD. In Figure 129, such data for five assays is presented. OD may be normalized as \"relative OD\" = (OD ¨ OD min)/(0Dmax ¨ OD min). In some cases, there is a somewhat curved relationship but the correlation coefficient (R) is usually > 0.99.[00570]    The parameter f may be used to calibrate assays measured by 3-color image analysis. When plotted against concentration of the analyte, a smooth calibration relationship may be shown in Figure 130 for a representative cholesterol assay. An equation of the form concentration = a + b*f + c*f2 (where a, b and c are constants) relating concentration to f is derived and as shown in Figure 130, the calculated concentration is essentially identical to that of the \"nominal\" (expected, desired) value (regression line slope close to 1.0, intercept close to 0.0 and R2 = 0.998. Also shown in Figure 130 are graphs of assay accuracy and precision. Accuracy is close to 100 % (mean 100.2 %) and imprecision (represented by CV %) is low (less than 10 %, average CV 3.9 %).[00571]    Simultaneous imaging of assays [00572]    As shown in Figure 56, Figure 57, Figure 58, Figure 59, and Figure 60, several assay elements (tips, welts, blots) can be imaged in parallel. In general, the elements can be placed at known locations in a cartridge or mounted on a subsystem of the instrument, so that a particular element can be associated with a particular assay. Even if the elements are not perfectly oriented or located, image analysis can be used to rectify any such miss-positioning by locating features of the assay elements.[00573]    Commercially available assays for albumin (Figure 56) and cholesterol (Figure 57) were used according to the manufacturer's directions. A series of analyte concentrations in the range of clinical interest was measured using a series of calibrators in which the analyte concentration was reduced two-fold from the ;A 028251962013-07-18 highest concentration. In Figure 56 and Figure 57, analyte concentration was highest on the right and the furthest left tip corresponded to zero analyte. The volume of assay reaction mixture aspirated into the tips was 20 uL.[00574]    Figure 58, Figure 59, and Figure 60 show wells that can be imaged in parallel. A set of shallow hemispherical wells was made by machining a block of white opaque plastic. Three commercially available color forming assays were performed in these wells and reaction products imaged. As above, the wells to the far right have the highest analyte concentration and each adjacent well has a two-fold lower concentration except the left-most well which has zero analyte. Seven uL of assay reaction product were introduced into each well.[00575]    Reaction products can also be imaged after blotting them onto porous membranes or paper and imaging once the liquid has soaked into the medium. It is also possible to use any of a variety of assay chemistries impregnated into paper or membranes and to image the resulting reaction products following addition of sample.[00576]    Analyzing Turbidity [00577]    Turbidimetry is performed by measuring the reduction in the intensity of the incident light after it passes through the sample being measured. This technique is used where the result of the assay is a dispersed precipitate that increases the opacity of the liquid.[00578]    Turbidimetry can be measured in latex agglutination assays. As a model of latex agglutination assay responses, polystyrene latex particles (1 urn diameter) were dispersed in buffer at the given (w/v) concentrations and subject to three-color image analysis. As can be seen in Figure 72, a good response was found in all three channels and could be used to measure the latex particle concentration and agglutination of latex.[00579]    Analyzing Agglutination [00580]    Similarly to turbidity analysis, the system can be used to measure agglutination, hemagglutination, and the inhibition thereof.[00581]    The system can be used to perform blood typing by red blood cell agglutination. Blood was diluted and mixed with blood typing reagents (anti-A, anti-B, anti-D) from a commercial typing kit. As shown below for a B+ blood, the appropriate agglutination responses can easily be seen when the mixtures are imaged. Moreover, when the images shown in Figure 77 were scanned along the vertical axis of the tips, a quantitative measure of agglutination could be obtained by measuring the variance of the three-color signals, as shown in Figure 78. Greater variance indicated agglutination and can be detected in each color channel. It is evident that the method can be used to measure the extent of such agglutination reactions.[00582]    Shape Recognition [00583]    Images can be analyzed for shape recognition. Shape recognition can be performed at normal magnification and at very high magnification. Under high magnification image analysis may be used to recognize the size and shape of cells. These techniques are commonly used in cell counting to determine relative concentrations of red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. Under normal magnification, shape recognition is used to observe the state of the sample. Bubble and other defect recognition methods are used to ensure that measured liquid amounts are aspirated and dispensed correctly.[00584]    Analyzing samples on solid phase substrates ;A 028251962013-07-18 [00585]    Digital imaging with front-face illumination can also be used to read out assay responses on solid phase substrates as shown in Figure 76. Solutions of potassium chloride (0, 2, 4 and 8 mM) were added to ReflotronTM potassium assay strips (Boehringer-Mannheim/Roche) designed for use in a reflectance assay system.[00586]    Analyzing sample quality [00587]    Certain sample characteristics can render assay results invalid. For example, hemolysis causes potassium ions to leak from red cells into plasma causing the measured plasma or serum potassium ion concentrations to be falsely high. Similarly, icteria and lipemia can interfere with several color-forming chemistries by altering the measured absorbances. In the present invention, we can detect and quantify such interfering substances using image analysis. Assays which would give false results can then be either (1) eliminated from the list of results delivered by the analytical system or (2) optical signals can be corrected to account for the measured level of interferent. An image of different types of serum samples is shown in Figure 99 (from left to right: Hemolyzed, Lipemic, Icteric (yellow) and \"normal\").[00588]    Digital data analysis [00589]    Conventional methods for data generation and calibration in assay methods which generate and/or change color typically measure an analog signal representing the change in absorbance characteristics of an assay mixture generated by mixing a sample with reagents. Some portion of the reaction mixture is illuminated and the light transmitted through or reflected from that portion impinges on a detector and evaluated as an analog signal. The quality of the assay as determined by the volume and quality of the sample, sample processing, assembly of the assay into the assay mixture and of the physical element used to present the mixture to the optical system rely on an assumed quality of the physical system used.[00590]    In the present invention, we can image (1) the sample, (2) sample processing processes, and (3) the assay mixture and collect the data as a set of one or more digital images. Each pixel in the image of the assay mixture represents a very small fraction of the total but by averaging the 3-color signal from many pixels, we collect an assay signal at least as good as that obtained by conventional analog methods. Where however, conventional methods lose information by averaging, the present invention both aggregates the information and retains the detail lost by conventional methods. In this context, color-based assays include assays for: Metabolites, Electrolytes, Enzymes, Biomarkers (using immunoassay), Drugs (using immunoassay), and Nucleic acid targets (using \"LAMP\" technology). The same principles can be applied to assays using fluorescence and/or luminescence.[00591]    Volume confirmation and correction [00592]    The volume of a sample, or any other material, such as a liquid or a solid, can be determined optically. This can be performed by imaging a container whose internal dimensions are known and mathematically determining sample volume from observed segment of the container occupied. Solid measurements are primarily used to measure solids that are centrifuged down. The most common case is reading the volume of centrifuged red blood cells to determining hematocrit level. Examples 6-11 and 16 describe the use of imaging analysis to calculate sample volumes and other measurements. This can allow for improved assay results. For example, if the target volume to be used is 10 uL and the technology of the invention determines that the actual volume is 8 tilL, the assay system can correct the results for the volume (in ;A 028251962013-07-18 this example, the concentration of analytes calculated on thc presumption of a 10 uL sample would be multiplied by 10/8).[00593]    Knowledge of actual sample and reagent volumes can be performed by imaging the sample and reagents and can be used to correct the calculations used to detect and/or quantify analytcs in the sample.[00594]    As shown in many examples above, the use of imaging allows samples and assay mixtures to be evaluated for quality and assay response. Additionally, imaging of 'tips\" used as reaction vessels and sample acquisition methods enables (1) the accurate and precise measurement of sample and reagent volumes and (2) the use of such data to correct any inaccuracies and or imprecision in assay results due to volume errors. To achieve this, tips can have accurately and precisely known geometry (as is the case for tips made by injection molding). Replicate measurements of tips using imaging has demonstrated that their dimensions are precise to better than about 1 %. It is thus possible to measure the volume of liquid samples and reagents in such tips with corresponding precision. If the pipetting of samples and reagents is less accurate and precise, correction of results knowing the actual volumes (by image measurement) is possible.[00595]    For example, consider an assay in which the response is directly proportional to analyte concentration (as is true for many of the assays discussed herein). A sample volume error of 10 % would lead to an error of 10 % in the value reported by the analytical system. If however, the inaccurately dispensed sample volume is measured accurately (say to within 2 % of the actual value), the system response can be corrected so as to reduce the error from 10 % to 2 %. Corresponding corrections can be made for volume errors in reagent volumes. The correction algorithm can depend on the response of the assay system to volume or knowledge of each assay component (sample, reagents), but this information can easily be determined during assay development and validation.[00596]    Thus, the invention provides a variety of advantages over conventional techniques. In the generation of the \"assay signal.\", the present invention can detect physical defects in the assay cuvette, defects in the assay mixture (bubbles and the like). Once these defects are identified (image analysis) the assay result can be rejected so that false results do not occur or (preferred) the effect of the defect can be eliminated and an accurate assay signal computed.[00597]    In the assembly of the assay mixture, any and all defects can be detected including: incorrect sample type (e.g. blood versus plasma), incorrect sample volume, for a blood sample, failure to separate plasma from formed elements (red and white cells), sample factors that may compromise the quality of the assay result (e.g., lipemia, icteria, hemolysis, presence of precipitates, or other unidentified in-homogeneities), defects in assembly of the assay mixture (e.g., presence of bubbles, failure to mix adequately (non-uniformity of color)), mechanisms for retrospective quality evaluation and preservation of detailed archival information, mechanisms for measuring sample and reagent volumes (and to correct for inaccuracies and/or imprecision in such volumes).[00598]    Assessing Therapeutic Agents [00599]    In a separate embodiment, devices and methods for monitoring more than one pharmacological parameter useful for assessing efficacy and/or toxicity of a therapeutic agent is provided. For example, a therapeutic agent can include any substances that have therapeutic utility and/or potential. Such substances include but are not limited to biological or chemical compounds such as simple or complex organic or inorganic molecules, peptides, proteins (e.g. antibodies) or a polynucleotides (e.g. anti-sense). A vast array of compounds can be synthesized, for example polymers, such as polypeptides and polynucleotides, and synthetic organic ;A 028251962013-07-18 compounds bascd on various corc structures, and these can also be included as thcrapcutic agents. In addition, various natural sources can provide compounds for screening, such as plant or animal extracts, and the like. It should be understood, although not always explicitly stated that the agent is used alone or in combination with another agent, having the same or different biological activity as the agents identified by the inventive screen. The agents and methods also are intended to be combined with other therapies. For example, small molecule drugs are often measured by mass-spectrometry which can be imprecise. ELISA (antibody-based) assays can be much more accurate and precise.[00600]    Physiological parameters according to the present invention include without limitation parameters such as temperature, heart rate/pulse, blood pressure, and respiratory rate. Pharmacodynamic parameters include concentrations of biomarkers such as proteins, nucleic acids, cells, and cell markers. Bioinarkers could be indicative of disease or could be a result of the action of a drug. Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters according to the present invention include without limitation drug and drug metabolite concentration. Identifying and quantifying the PK parameters in real time from a sample volume is extremely desirable for proper safety and efficacy of drugs. If the drug and metabolite concentrations are outside a desired range and/or unexpected metabolites are generated due to an unexpected reaction to the drug, immediate action may be necessary to ensure the safety of the patient. Similarly, if any of the pharmacodynamic (PD) parameters fall outside the desired range during a treatment regime, immediate action may have to be taken as well.[00601]    Being able to monitor the rate of change of an analyte concentration or PD or PK parameters over a period of time in a single subject, or performing trend analysis on the concentration, PD, or PK parameters, whether they are concentrations of drugs or their metabolites, can help prevent potentially dangerous situations. For example, if glucose were the analytc of interest, the concentration of glucose in a sample at a given time as well as the rate of change of the glucose concentration over a given period of time could be highly useful in predicting and avoiding, for example, hypoglycemic events. Such trend analysis has widespread beneficial implications in drug dosing regimen. When multiple drugs and their metabolites are concerned, the ability to spot a trend and take proactive measures is often desirable.[00602]    Tn sonic embodiments, the present invention provides a business method of assisting a clinician in providing an individualized medical treatment. A business method can comprise post prescription monitoring of drug therapy by monitoring trends in biomarkers over time. The business method can comprise collecting at least one pharmacological parameter from an individual receiving a medication, said collecting step is effected by subjecting a sample of bodily fluid to reactants contained in a fluidic device, which is provided to said individual to yield a detectable signal indicative of said at least one pharmacological parameter; and cross referencing with the aid of a computer medical records of said individual with the at least one pharmacological parameter of said individual, thereby assisting said clinician in providing individualized medical treatment.[00603]    The devices, systems, and methods herein allow for automatic quantification of a pharmacological parameter of a patient as well as automatic comparison of the parameter with, for example, the patient's medical records which may include a history of the monitored parameter, or medical records of another group of subjects. Coupling real-time analytc monitoring with an external device which can store data as well as perform any type of data processing or algorithm, for example, provides a device that can assist with typical patient care which can include, for example, comparing current patient data with past patient data. Therefore, also provided ;A 028251962013-07-18 herein is a business method which effectively performs at least part of the monitoring of a patient that is currently performed by medical personnel.[00604]    Optical Setup for Sample and Reaction Product Imaging [00605]    Sample and reaction product analysis can be performed using an optical setup. The optical setup can includes a light source, an aperture, and a sensor or a detector. A schematic for an optical setup is shown in Figure 100 and Figure 101. In some embodiments, the camera can be a Logitech C600 Webcamera, the camera sensor can be a 1/3\" 2.0 MP (1600x1200) CMOS: (MI-2010-SOC), the lens can be glass with a standard object distance webcam lens (Lens-to-Object distance: 35mm). The light source can be a Moritex White Edge Tlluminator MERL-Cw25 (white) operating at 9.4 volts. Camera images can be taken in a sequence where 1, 2, 3 4, or more tips are moved by an x-y-z stage into the optical path.[00606]    In an embodiment, the detector is a reader assembly housing a detection assembly for detecting a signal produced by at least one assay on the device. The detection assembly may be above the device or at a different orientation in relation to the device based on, for example, the type of assay being performed and the detection mechanism being employed. The detection assembly can be moved into communication with the assay unit or the assay unit can be moved into communication with the detection assembly.[00607]    The sensors can be PMTs, wide range photo diodes, avalanche photodiodes, single frequency photo diodes, image sensors, CMOS chips, and CCDs. The illumination sources can be lasers, single color LEDs, broad frequency light from fluorescent tamps or LEDs, LED arrays, mixtures of red, green, and blue light sources, phosphors activated by an LED, fluorescent tubes, incandescent lights, and arc sources, such as a flash tube.[00608]    In many instances, an optical detector is provided and used as the detection device. Non-limiting examples include a photodiode, photomultiplier tube (PMT), photon counting detector, avalanche photo diode, or charge-coupled device (CCD). In some embodiments a pin diode may be used. In some embodiments a pin diode can be coupled to an amplifier to create a detection device with a sensitivity comparable to a PMT. Some assays may generate luminescence as described herein. In some embodiments chemiluminescence is detected. In some embodiments a detection assembly could include a plurality of fiber optic cables connected as a bundle to a CCD detector or to a PMT array. The fiber optic bundle could be constructed of discrete fibers or of many small fibers fused together to form a solid bundle. Such solid bundles are commercially available and easily interfaced to CCD detectors.[00609]    A detector can also comprise a light source, such as a bulb or light emitting diode (LED). The light source can illuminate an assay in order to detect the results. For example, the assay can be a fluorescence assay or an absorbance assay, as are commonly used with nucleic acid assays. The detector can also comprise optics to deliver the light source to the assay, such as a lens or fiber optics.[00610]    In some embodiments, the detection system may comprise non-optical detectors or sensors for detecting a particular parameter of a subject. Such sensors may include temperature, conductivity, potentiometric signals, and amperometric signals, for compounds that are oxidized or reduced, for example, 02, H202, and or oxidizable/reducible organic compounds.[00611]    The illumination can be back lit, front lit, and oblique (side) lit. Back lighting can be used in general chemistry for the purpose of detecting either light absorption (coloiimetry) or scattering (turbidity). The arrangement takes two forms, a broad, evenly illuminated rear field, and a specifically shaped beam that is ;A 028251962013-07-18 interrupted by the subject. Front lit illumination can be used for reflectance and fluorescence excitation. In reflectance, a subject is lit from the front by a light source are measured by observing the light reflected from the subject. The colors absorbed produce the same information as a liquid illuminated by a back light. In reflectance, a subject can also be illuminated using oblique lighting. The use of oblique (from the side) illumination gives the image a 3-dimensional appearance and can highlight otherwise invisible features. A more recent technique based on this method is Hoffmann's modulation contrast, a system found on inverted microscopes for use in cell culture. Oblique illumination suffers from the same limitations as bright field microscopy (low contrast of many biological samples; low apparent resolution due to out of focus objects), but may highlight otherwise invisible structures.[00612]    In fluorescence excitation, subjects can be illuminated from the front for the purpose of fluorescence illumination. These are usually single color lights, most commonly lasers. The Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope is a common embodiment of this. Oblique lighting can also be used in fluorescence excitation. In fluorescence cytometry, the subjects are often excited at an angle, usually 90 degrees, from which the decay photons will appear. This form of lighting enables scatter detection directly behind the subject (back lit) as well as the fluorescence emissions exiting from the side.[00613]    In some embodiments, fluorescent light is imaged at 90 degrees to the excitation beam. In Figure 102A, a photon source (S), typically a high-intensity LED, passes through a beam diffuser (D) and a shaping lens (Li), producing a collimated or slowly diverging excitation beam. The excitation beam passes through a band-pass filter (F1) and illuminates the sample, consisting of a vessel (tube, cuvette, or pipette tip) containing a solution with a fluorescently-labeled sample. Isotropically-emitted fluorescence is spectrally separated from excitation light with a long- or band-pass filter (F2) appropriate to pass Stokes-shifted fluorescence. Light is then imaged through a lens (L2) onto a digital camera (C) or other detector. Fluorescence intensity is extracted from the resulting images via image analysis.[00614]    Images taken using the optical setup shown in Figure 102A produces single-tube images (as shown in Figure 103A. Successive experiments show the difference in fluorescence intensity from Negative and Positive LAMP experiments using intercalating dye.[00615]    In other embodiments, transmitted light is imaged after optical filtering to remove the light at the exciting wavelength. In Figure 102B, a photon source (S), typically a high-intensity LED, passes through a beam diffuser (D) and a shaping lens (L1), producing slowly divergent, elliptical excitation beam. The excitation beam passes through a band-pass filter (F1) and illuminates the samples, presented as an array of sample vessels (tube, cuvette, or pipette tip), each containing a solution with a fluorescently-labeled sample. Isotropically-emitted fluorescence is spectrally separated from excitation light with a long- or band-pass filter (F2) appropriate to pass Stokes-shifted fluorescence. Light is then imaged through a camera lens (L2) onto a digital camera (C). Fluorescence intensity is extracted from the resulting images via image analysis. The optical setup shown in Figure 103 can be used to produces array images of multiple tubes simultaneously (as shown in Figure 103B).[00616]    For colorimetry, the preferred embodiment for sensing is backlighting the subject with white light with the result sensed by an imaging sensor. In this case the transmissive color absorption is measured.   ;A 028251962013-07-18 [00617]    For Turbiclimetry, the preferred embodiment for sensing is backlighting the subject with white light with the result sensed by an imaging sensor. For turbidimetry, the reduction of the intensity of the transmitted light is measured.[00618]    Luminometry utilizes no illumination method as the subject emits its own photons. The emitted light can be weak and can be detecting using an extremely sensitive sensor such as a photomultiplier tube (PMT).[00619]    In some embodiments, imaging may occur using fluorescence, darkfield illumination, or brightfield illumination. Such imaging can be used for cytometry or other applications. Epi-fluorescence illumination may be achieved by the use of three illumination sources of differing wavelengths. Further, two different sources can be used simultaneously, if required. Consequently, the imaging platform can be used to image a large variety of fluorescent dyes. The combination of illumination sources and emission optics can be configured to achieve a plurality of spectrally independent channels of imaging.[00620]    Darkfield illumination may be achieved by the use of a ringlight (located either above or below the sample), a darkfield abbe condenser, a darkfield condenser with a toroidal mirror, an epi-darkfield condenser built within a sleeve around the objective lens, or a combination of ringlight with a stage condenser equipped with a dark stop. Fundamentally, these optical components create a light cone of numerical aperture (NA) greater than the NA of the objective being used. The choice of the illumination scheme depends upon a number of considerations such as magnification required, mechanical design considerations, size of the imaging sensor etc. A ringlight based illumination scheme generally provides uniform darkfield illumination over a wider area while at the same time providing sufficient flexibility in mechanical design of the overall system.[00621]    Brightfield illumination may be achieved by the use of a white light source along with a stage-condenser to create Koehler illumination.[00622]    In some embodiments, an automatic filter wheel may be employed. The automatic filter wheel allows control of the imaging optical path to enable imaging of multiple fluorophorcs on the same field of view.[00623]    In some embodiments, image based auto-focusing may take place. An image-based algorithm may be used to control the z-position (e.g., vertical position) of an objective (i.e., its distance from the sample) to achieve auto-focusing. Briefly, a small image (for example, 128x128 pixels) is captured at a fast rate using darkfield illumination. This image may be analyzed to derive the auto-focus function which is measure of image sharpness. Based on a fast search algorithm the next z-location of the objective is calculated. The objective may be moved to the new z-location and another small image may be captured. This closed-loop system does not require the use of any other hardware for focusing. The microscope stage may be connected to computer-controlled stepper motors to allow translation in the X and Y directions (e.g., horizontal directions). At every location, the desired number of images is captured and the stage is moved to the next XY position.[00624]    Imaging or other sensing may be performed with the aid of a detector. A detector can include a camera or other sensing apparatus configured to convert electromagnetic radiation to an electronic signal. In an example, a camera can be a charge-coupled (CCD) or electron-multiplying CCD (EMCCD) camera. A detector may be a sensor, such as an active pixel sensor or CMOS sensor. A detector may include a photo-multiplier tube for detecting a signal.[00625]    The detector can be in optical communication with a sample container (e.g., cuvette, tip, vial). In some cases, the detector is in direct line of sight of the sample container. In other cases, the detector is in optical ;A 028251962013-07-18 communication with the sample container with the aid of one or more optics, such as lenses, mirrors, collimators, or combinations thereof.[00626]    Cell counting can be performed using imaging and cytometry. In situations where the subjects may be bright-field illuminated, the preferred embodiment is to illuminate the subjects from the front with a white light and to sense the cells with an imaging sensor. Subsequent digital processing will count the cells. Where the cells are infrequent or are small, the preferred embodiment is to attach a fluorescent marker, and then illuminating the subject field with a laser. Confocal scanning imaging is preferred. For flow cytometry, the subjects are marked with fluorescent markers and flowed past the sensing device. There are two types of sensors, one is position such that the subject is back lit, measuring beam scatter to determine presence of a cell. The other sensor, aligned so that the illumination is from the side, measures the fluorescent light emitted froin the marked subjects. Further description is provided below relating to imaging methodology for cytometry.[00627]    End-User Systems [00628]    A device and system may, after manufacturing, be shipped to the end user, together or individually. The device or system of the invention can be packaged with a user manual or instructions for use. In an embodiment, the system of the invention is generic to the type of assays run on different devices. Because components of the device can be modular, a user may only need one system and a variety of devices or assay units or reagent units to run a multitude of assays in a point-of-care or other distributed testing environment. In this context, a system can be repeatedly used with multiple devices, and it may be necessary to have sensors on both the device and the system to detect such changes during shipping, for example. During shipping, pressure or temperature changes can impact the performance of a number of components of the present system, and as such a sensor located on either the device or system can relay these changes to, for example, the external device so that adjustments can be made during calibration or during data processing on the external device. For example, if the temperature of a fluidic device is changed to a certain level during shipping, a sensor located on the device could detect this change and convey this information to the system when the device is inserted into the system by the user. There may be an additional detection device in the system to perform these tasks, or such a device may be incorporated into another system component. In some embodiments information may be wirelessly transmitted to either the system or the external device, such as a personal computer or a television. Likewise, a sensor in the system can detect similar changes. In some embodiments, it may be desirable to have a sensor in the shipping packaging as well, either instead of in the system components or in addition thereto. For example, adverse conditions that would render an assay cartridge or system invalid that can be sensed can include exposure to a temperature higher than the maximum tolerable or breach of the cartridge integrity such that moisture penetration.[00629]    In an embodiment, the system comprises a communication assembly capable of transmitting and receiving information wirelessly from an external device. Such wireless communication may be Bluetooth or RTM technology. Various communication methods can be utilized, such as a dial-up wired connection with a modem, a direct link such as a Ti, ISDN, or cable line. In some embodiments, a wireless connection is established using exemplary wireless networks such as cellular, satellite, or pager networks, GPRS, or a local data transport system such as Ethernet or token ring over a local area network. In some embodiments the information is encrypted before it is transmitted over a wireless network. In some embodiments the ;A 028251962013-07-18 communication assembly may contain a wireless infrared communication component for sending and receiving information. The system may include integrated graphic cards to facilitate display of information.[00630]    In some embodiments the communication assembly can have a memory or storage device, for example localized RAM, in which the information collected can be stored. A storage device may be required if information cannot be transmitted at a given time due to, for example, a temporary inability to wirelessly connect to a network. The information can be associated with the device identifier in the storage device. In some embodiments the communication assembly can retry sending the stored information after a certain amount of time.[00631]    In some embodiments an external device communicates with the communication assembly within the reader assembly. An external device can wirelessly or physically communicate with a system, but can also communicate with a third party, including without limitation a patient, medical personnel, clinicians, laboratory personnel, or others in the health care industry.[00632]    In some embodiments the system can comprise an external device such as a computer system, server, or other electronic device capable of storing information or processing information. In some embodiments the external device includes one or more computer systems, servers, or other electronic devices capable of storing information or processing information. In some embodiments an external device may include a database of patient information, for example but not limited to, medical records or patient history, clinical trial records, or preclinical trial records. An external device can store protocols to be run on a system which can be transmitted to the communication assembly of a system when it has received an identifier indicating which device has been inserted in the system. In some embodiments a protocol can be dependent on a device identifier. In some embodiments the external device stores more than one protocol for each device. In other embodiments patient information on the external device includes more than one protocol. In some instances, the external server stores mathematical algorithms to process a photon count sent from a communication assembly and in some embodiments to calculate the analyte concentration in a bodily fluid sample.[00633]    In some embodiments, the external device can include one or more servers as are known in the art and commercially available. Such servers can provide load balancing, task management, and backup capacity in the event of failure of one or more of the servers or other components of the external device, to improve the availability of the server. A server can also be implemented on a distributed network of storage and processor units, as known in the art, wherein the data processing according to the present invention reside on workstations such as computers, thereby eliminating the need for a server.[00634]    A server can includes a database and system processes. A database can reside within the server, or it can reside on another server system that is accessible to the server. As the information in a database may contain sensitive information, a security system can be implemented that prevents unauthorized users from gaining access to the database.[00635]    One advantage of some of the features described herein is that information can be transmitted from the external device back to not only the reader assembly, but to other parties or other external devices, for example without limitation, a PDA or cell phone. Such communication can be accomplished via a wireless network as disclosed herein. In some embodiments a calculated analyte concentration or other patient information can be sent to, for example but not limited to, medical personnel or the patient.   ;A 028251962013-07-18 [00636]    Accordingly, the data generated with the use of the subject devices and systems can be utilized for performing a trend analysis on the concentration of an analyte in a subject which changes over time.[00637]    Another advantage as described herein is that assay results can be substantially immediately communicated to any third party that may benefit from obtaining the results. For example, once the analyte concentration is determined at the external device, it can be transmitted to a patient or medical personnel who may need to take further action. The communication step to a third party can be performed w-irelessly as described herein, and by transmitting the data to a third party's hand held device, the third party can be notified of the assay results virtually anytime and anywhere. Thus, in a time-sensitive scenario, a patient may be contacted immediately anywhere if urgent medical action may be required.[00638]    As described elsewhere herein, imaging may be used for detection. Imaging can be used to detect one or more characteristic of a sample. For example, imaging maybe used to detect the presence or absence of a sample. The imaging may be used to detect the location, placement, volume or concentration of a sample. The imaging may be used to detect the presence, absence, and/or concentration of one or more analytes in the sample.[00639]    In some embodiments, a single measurement may be used to capture various information about a sample and/or analytes. For example, a single measurement may be used to capture information about the volume of a sample and the concentration of an analyte within the sample. A single measurement may be used to capture information about the presence and/or concentration of a plurality of analytes and/or types of analytes within the sample. A single image may be used to capture information relating to one, two, or more of the information or types of information described herein.[00640]    Such imaging and detection may provide more precise and accurate assays, which may be advantageous in situations with small sample volumes, such as those described elsewhere herein. Additional examples of volumes of sample may include 500 i_tt or less, 250 p1 or less, 200 [it or less, 175 i_tt or less, 150 ttL OT less, 100 [IL OT less, 80 pL OT less, 70 [IL OT less, 60 [IL OT less, 50 tilL, OT less, 30 tilL, or less, 20 p1 or less, 15 ILL or less, 10 ILL or less, 8 ILL or less, 5 litL or less, 1 j_iL or less, 500 nL or less, 300 nL or less, 100 nL or less, 50 nL or less, 10 nL or less, 1 nL or less, 500 pL or less, 250 pL or less, 100 pL or less, 50 pL or less, 10 pL or less, 5 pL or less, or 1 pL or less. In some embodiments, the sample volume may include less than or equal to about 3 drops from a fingerstick, less than or equal to about 2 drops from a fingerstick, or less than or equal to about 1 drop from a fingerstick. Such small volumes may be useful in point of service applications.[00641]    Such imaging and/or detection may yield assays with low coefficient of variation. A coefficient of variation may be the ratio between the standard deviation and an absolute value of the mean. In an embodiment, a reaction and/or assay may have a coefficient of variation (CV) (also \"relative standard deviation\" herein) less than or equal to about 20%, 15%, 12%, 10%, 9%, 8%, 7%, 6%, 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, 1%, 0.5%, 0.3%, or 0.1%. A single reaction and/or assay, or a procedure with a plurality of reactions and/or assays may have a coefficient of variation of less than or equal to about 20%, 15%, 12%, 10%, 9%, 8%, 7%, 6%, 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, 1%, 0.5%, 0.3%, or 0.1%. In some embodiments, an imaging and/or detection step, or a procedure with a plurality of imaging and/or detection steps may have a coefficient of variation of less than or equal to about 20%, 15%, 12%, 10%, 9%, 8%, 7%, 6%, 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, 1%, 0.5%, 0.3%, or 0.1%.[00642]    In some embodiments, the use of imaging with a device that may be placed at a point of service location may improve the overall performance of the device. The accuracy and/or precision may be improved ;A 028251962013-07-18 and/or thc coefficient of variation may be reduced. The performance of the device may bc improved when handling small samples, such as those volumes described herein. The imaging may be used in combination with other detection systems, in combination with other processes, or as a standalone system. Improvement in performance may include a decrease in the coefficient of variation of about 15%, 12%, 10%, 9%, 8%, 7%, 6%, 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, 1%, 0.5%, 0.3%, or 0.1%.[00643]    Imaging may be useful for various detection types for one or more types of assays or sample handling procedures. Examples of such assays or sample handling procedures may include centrifugation, separation, cytometry, immunoassay, ELISA, nucleic acid assay, enzymatic assay, colorimetry, or any other type of assay or reaction described elsewhere herein.[00644]    Imaging systems may provide multiple advantages over other methods for data collection, data processing, and results interpretation. Imaging systems may maximize, or increase the efficiency of, the use of small samples and enhancing system-level performance. Imaging systems may be used for detection as standalone systems or may be used in combination with other detection systems or mechanisms.[00645]    In some systems, sensors and systems may be used (such as photodiodes and photomultiplier tubes and associated optics/devices) that typically do not provide any spatial information about the sample being interrogated. Rather, these systems may collect information about the sample after the information has been spatially integrated, typically losing spatial information related to the sample. While integrating the signal in space from the sample may augment the signal levels being detected by the sensor, advances in sensitivity of optical and other sensors may negate the need for such integration. Imaging for detection may be used in the place of such sensors, or may be used in conjunction with such sensors.[00646]    Imaging systems may be used that may advantageously have one or more of the following features. Imaging sensors may have sensitivity and dynamic range that meet and/or exceed that of conventional non-imaging sensors. Imaging devices may maintain spatial aspects of the sample being interrogated, providing significant ability for post processing. Post processing can include QA/QC (e.g., quality control, such as automated error detection and/or review by pathologist), and/or image analysis to extract specific sample features. The imaging device can utilize 3D, 2D, 1D (line sensors), and/or point sensors with a means to translate the sample relative to the collection optics/sensor to enable the spatial reconstruction of the sample. Data collected from the imaging device can be processed to extract very specific information, such as morphological features of the sample (such as cell counts), data from select regions of the image (peak fluorescence across a sample or in a cell within the image). Data collected from the imaging device can be processed to improve the sensitivity and resolution of the measurement. Data collected from the imaging device can enable the assessment of signal variation across the sample being imaged. The data may be post processed to calculate mean, standard deviation, maximum, minimum, and/or other applicable statistics across the sample or within any regions of interest identified in the sample images. Imaging devices enable the exploration or changes in the sample over time by collecting multiple images and comparing changes in the images over time and space, such as would be evident in an aggregation processes (such as for an assay of prothrombin time) or other (e.g., chemical, physical, biologic, electrical, morphological) changes in the sample over time and space. Imaging devices may enable more rapid data acquisition of arrays, tissue sections, and other assay/sample configurations.   ;A 028251962013-07-18 [00647]    Cytometry Application [00648]    In some embodiments, any of the embodiments described herein may be adapted to enable the system to perform cytometry. Cytometry (e.g., enumeration and function analysis of cells) in the system may be performed using image analysis. Blood can be processed using the pipette and centrifuge as described previously herein. Typically, a known measured volume of blood (1 ¨ 50 uL) may first be centrifuged and the plasma fraction removed. The cell fraction may then be re-suspended into buffer by use of the pipette repeatedly to dispense and aspirate. A cocktail of fluorescent antibodies may be directed to selected cell markers (such as CD45, CD4 etc.). Following a brief incubation, a reagent which may act as a fixative for the white cells and a lysing agent for red cells can be added. Following another incubation white cells may be collected by centrifugation and the supernatant hemolysate removed by aspiration. The stained white cells can be re-suspended in a measured volume of buffer (typically less than the original blood volume (say 1 ¨ 20 uL) and dispensed into transparent capillary channels for image analysis. Typically up to three or even five or more cell types can be imaged using antibodies having different fluorescent labels or and/or antibodies labeled with different fluor/protein ratios. When more cell types have to be counted or analyzed, more than one reaction mixture can be used. In some embodiments, a reaction mixture can be used to count or analyze various numbers of cell types.[00649]    In some embodiments, the capillary channels are typically about 10 ¨ 100 um deep, 0.5 ¨ 2 mm wide and 0.5 ¨ 5 cm long. The capillary charmels may have other dimensions, including but limited to other dimensions described elsewhere herein. The stained cell dispersion may fill the channel usually by capillary action and the cells may be allowed to settle on the lower channel surface. The channels can be illuminated with one or more lasers or other light sources (e.g., LEDs). The optical train may have one or more optical elements, such as dichroic mirrors or lenses, and may or may not magnify the field of view. In some embodiments, the field of view may be magnified 2 ¨ 100 fold. A series of images may be collected typically representing a field of view of about 1 mm x 0.5 mm and which contains 1 10,000 cells (ideally, 300 cells of interest) imaged onto a sensor having an area of about 1000 x 1000 pixels (1 million total).[00650]    A series of images representing adjacent sections of channel may be collected. A mechanical stage can be used to move the channels relative to the light source. In some cases, a servo-mechanism may move the stage in a vertical direction so as to focus the image. In some embodiments, the light source or one or more optical elements may move relative to the stage to focus the image. Images are usually made using one or more combinations of light sources and optical filters. The light sources may be turned on and off and filters moved into the light path as needed. Preferably up to 1000 cells of any given type may be counted. In other embodiments, various numbers of cells of any given type may be counted, including but not limited to more than, less than, or equal to about 1 cell, 5 cells, 10 cells, 30 cells, 50 cells, 100 cells, 150 cells, 200 cells, 300 cells, 500 cells, 700 cells, 1000 cells, 1500 cells, 2000 cells, 3000 cells, 5000 cells. Cells may be counted using available counting algorithms. Cells can be recognized by their characteristic fluorescence, size and shape. Pattern recognition algorithms may be employed to exclude stained cell debris and in most cases where there are cells which are aggregated these can either be excluded from the analysis or interpreted as aggregates.[00651]    A cytometry platform may be an integrated automated microscopy device capable of the following tasks in a fully automated, controlled environment. One or more of the following tasks may occur in cytometry ;A 028251962013.07-18 applications. The following tasks may occur in the order thcy appear or in alternate orders or other tasks may be substitute as appropriate.1.    Isolation of blood cells of the desired type 2.    Labeling of cells with fluorescent and/or colored dyes and/or beads 3.    Confinement of cell suspension in an optically compatible cuvette 4. Imaging of cells using fluorescence microscopy, darkfield illumination, and/or brightfield illumination 5.    Automated analysis of images to extract desired cellular attributes 6. Automated analysis of extracted information using advanced statistical and classification methods to derive clinically reportable infoimation.In the following sections, each of these tasks is discussed in greater detail; images and sketches are provided wherever deemed necessary.[00652]    1. Isolation of blood cells of the desired type. Blood cells of a desired type may be isolated in accordance with one or more embodiments described elsewhere herein. For example, such isolation may occur as referred to in previous descriptions relating to the eytometry or the centrifuge.[00653]    2. Labeling of cells with Iluorescent and/or colored dyes and/or beads.[00654]    Specific fluorescent dyes may be employed. Cells of interest can be incubated with pre-aliquoted solutions of fluorescently labeled binders (e.g., antibodies, aptamers, etc.) which are specific to markers on these cells. A key consideration may be pairing 'bright\" or high extinction coefficient and high quantum yield fluors with markers for which cells have a lower binding capacity; and vice versa. For example, the marker CD22 may be expressed on B-lymphocytes at about one tenth the level as CD45. Given this relative expression, CD22 may be labeled with a \"bright\" dye and CD45 may be labeled with the \"dimmer\" dye. The markers to be labeled using this technique can be either intracellular or cell-surface markers. The sensitivity of detection and quantification can be improved by using a secondary labeling scheme for low expression markers. Briefly, a primary binder may be conjugated with another molecule which can be specifically recognized by a secondary binder. A secondary binder labeled with a higher number of fluorophores can then bind the primary binder in situ and enhance fluorescence signal. One scheme for achieving this may be the use of biotin conjugated anti-CD22 antibody which may be in turn recognized by an anti-biotin antibody that is labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC). The use of can dramatically enhance fluorescence signal. Figure 123 provides an example of a fluorescence micrograph showing labeled leukocytes. The example illustrates a fluorescence micrograph of Alexa-Fluor 647-anti-CD45 labeled human leukocytes in a fixed, lysecl blood sample. The pseudocolor scheme is used to enhance perception of the different between 'bright' cells (with high CD45 expression) and 'dim' cells (with low CD45 expression).[00655]    Color stains of cell smears may also be employed within the system. For example, the manual procedure given in StainRITETm Wright-Giemsa Stain (Polysciences Inc.) can be automated and read in the devices of the subject invention.[00656]    In some embodiments, non-specific fluorescent dyes can be used. For the purposes of differentiating leukocyte sub-populations, the platform can also use fluorescent dyes which may bind to nucleic acids (e.g., SYTO, Hoechst) or lipid membranes (e.g., Dil, DiD, FM-4-64).   ;A 028251962013-07-18 [00657]    3. confinement of cell suspension in an optically compatible cuvette.[00658]    In some embodiments, cytometry cuvettes may be designed to confine a pre-labeled cell suspension of fixed volume into a 'channel' fabricated so as to provide an optically clear imaging material above and below the cells. Sample may be introduced into the channel via a sample entry port. At some distance from the sample entry port, an air vent may allow the release of air pressure and flow of sample into the channel.[00659]    The channel dimensions may be designed to hold a pre-defined known volume of fluid, regardless of the volume dispensed at the sample entry port. Each cuvette may have multiple channels of same and/or different volumes, each with at least one sample entry port and at least one air vent.[00660]    The concentration of cells of interest in the sample can be adjusted during sample preparation such that after confinement in the cuvette, a desired number of cells per field of view in the imaging system can be achieved. One method for doing this may be to image a container with the cell dispersion and measure turbidity. Using a pre-established relationship between turbidity and cell count, the cell density can be calculated. Typically, the cell dispersion will be made in a volume of buffer such that with the lowest likely cell count, and the cell concentration will be greater than optimal for image-based cell counting. More buffer may then be added to bring the dispersion to the optimal level.[00661]    The imaging area of the cuvette may be designed so as to provide a sufficient number of cells for the application of interest. For example, counting the abundant RBCs may require counting of only 1000-2000 cells and hence a diluted sample and only a small imaging area in the cuvette. However, counting rare myeloblasts may require in some cases the ability to image more than 100,000 (total) cells. In such a scenario, the system may concentrate the cell suspension so that 100,000 cells may be imaged with a reasonable number of fields of view. Therefore, the channel on the cuvette dedicated to RBC imaging will be smaller than the one dedicated to imaging myeloblasts.[00662]    The cuvette may be designed to be picked up by a standard pipetting mechanism in an automated fashion to allow the transfer of the cuvette to the imaging platform. The pipetting mechanism's tip ejector can eject the cuvette from the pipetting mechanism onto the imaging platform. Registration of cuvette to imaging platform may take place in two steps. Upon transfer of the cuvette to the imaging platform, static registration features on the cuvette may interface with mating features on the imaging platform to align the cuvette parallel to the imaging platform's optical axis (X,Y registration). Registration may then be completed by a mechanism located on the imaging platform. This mechanism may bias the cuvette against a planar surface perpendicular to the imaging platform's optical axis (Z registration), thereby constraining the sample within the imaging platform's focal range.[00663]    4. Imaging of cells using fluorescence, darkfield illumination, brightfield illumination. The method of imaging the cells may also be applied to other applications of the invention described elsewhere herein. The imaging techniques, as previously described, can be used for other imaging uses.[00664]    Illumination capabilities: The cytometry platform may be designed to have three types of illumination schemes: epi-fluorescence, darkfield and brightfield. The modular nature of the setup also allows integration of phase-contrast and differential-interference contrast (DIC).[00665]    Epi-fluorescence illumination may be achieved by the use of three laser lines (e.g., 488nm, 532nm and 640nm), but the modular nature of the system also allows for integration of other light sources, such as other laser sources, LEDs and standard arc-lamps (e.g. Xenon, Mercury and Halogen). Further, two different sources ;A 028251962013.07-18 can be used simultaneously, if required. Consequently, the cytometry platform can be used to image a large variety of fluorescent dyes. The combination of illumination sources and emission optics can be configured to achieve various numbers (e.g., 3-5) spectrally independent channels of imaging.[00666]    Darkficld illumination may be achieved by the use of a ringlight (located either above or below the sample), a darkfield abbe condenser, a darkfield condenser with a toroidal mirror, an epi-darkfield condenser built within a sleeve around the objective lens, or a combination of ringlight with a stage condenser equipped with a dark stop. Fundamentally, these optical components can create a light cone of numerical aperture (NA) greater than the NA of the objective being used. The choice of the illumination scheme depends upon a number of considerations such as magnification required, mechanical design considerations, or size of the imaging sensor. A ringlight based illumination scheme generally provides uniform darkfield illumination over a wider area while at the same time providing sufficient flexibility in mechanical design of the overall system. Figure 124 provides an example of intracellular patterns using darkfield images. The example shows different intracellular patterns in darkfield images of human leukocytes. (a) A strong scattering pattern due to presence of granules in eosinophils, (b) a polymorphonuclear neutrophil with characteristic nucleolar lobes and (c) cells that do not scatter light to a significant degree (lymphocytes or basophils) [00667]    Brightfiekl illumination may be achieved by the use of a white light source along with a stage-condenser to create Koehler illumination. Figure 126 provides an example of brightfield images of human whole blood. The example shows brightfield images of a human whole blood smear stained with the Wright-Giemsa staining method. Characteristic patterns of staining of human leukocytes are apparent. The characteristically shaped red cells can also be identified in these images.[00668]    Automatic filter wheel: An automatic filter wheel may allow control of the imaging optical path to enable imaging of multiple fluorophores on the same field of view.[00669]    Image based auto-focusing: The cytometry platform may use an image-based algorithm to control the z-position (e.g., vertical position) of the objective (i.e., its distance from the sample) to achieve auto-focusing. Briefly, a small image (for example, 128x128 pixels) may be captured at a fast rate using darkfield illumination. This image may be analyzed to derive the auto-focus function which may be used to measure of image sharpness. Based on a fast search algorithm the next z-location of the objective may be calculated. The sample may be moved to the new z-location and another small image may be captured. In some embodiments, this closed-loop system does not require the use of any other hardware for focusing.[00670]    Translation of stage: The microscope stage may be connected to computer-controlled stepper motors to allow translation in the X and Y directions (e.g., horizontal directions). At every location, the desired number of images may be captured and the stage may be moved to the next XY position.[00671]    Imaging sensor: A camera with a CCD, EMCCD, CMOS or in some cases a photo-multiplier tube can be used to detect the signal.[00672]    5. Analysis of images to extract desired cellular attributes.[00673]    The cytometry platform may use different illumination techniques to acquire images that reveal diverse properties and features of the cells. Labeling with cell-marker specific binders may reveal the degree of expression of that particular marker on the cell surface or in the cell. Darkfield image may reveal the light scattering properties of the cell. The internal and external features of the cell which scatter more tight appear brighter and the features which scatter lesser amounts of light appear darker in a darkfield image. Cells such as ;A 028251962013.07-18 granulocytes havc internal granules of size range (100-500nm) which can scatter significant amount of light and generally appear brighter in darkfield images. Furthermore, the outer boundary of any cell may scatter light and may appear as a ring of bright light. The diameter of this ring may directly give the size of the cell. Brightfield images of cells can reveal cell size, phase-dense material within the cells and colored features in the cell if the cells have been previously stained.[00674]    An image processing library may extract one or more of the following information for each cell (but is not limited to the following):1.    Cell size 2. Quantitative measure of cell granularity (also popularly called side scatter, based on flow cytometry parlance) 3.    Quantitative measure of fluorescence in the each spectral channel of imaging, after compensating for cross-talk between spectral channels 4. Shape of the cell, as quantified by standard and custom shape attributes such as aspect ratio, Feret diameters, Kurtosis, moment of inertia, circularity, solidity etc.5.    Color, color distribution and shape of the cell, in cases where the cells have been stained with dyes (not attached to antibodies or other types of receptor).6. Intracellular patterns of staining or scattering or color that are defined as quantitative metrics of a biological feature, for example density of granules within cells in a darkficld image, or the number and size of nucleolar lobes in a Giemsa-Wright stained image of polymorphonuclear neutrophils etc.7.    Co-localization of features of the cell revealed in separate images [00675]    The image processing algorithms utilized in this step may use combinations of image filtering, edge detection, template matching, automatic thresholding, morphological operations and shape analysis of objects.[00676]    6. Analysis of extracted information using advanced statistical and classification methods to derive clinically reportable information.[00677]    Any number of measured attributed may be extracted from images of cells. For example, measured attributes of each cell extracted from the images can range from 7-15, thus creating a 7 to 15 dimensional space within which each cell is a point. If n measured attributes are extracted from the images, an n dimensional space may be provided, within which each cell is a point.[00678]    Based on data acquired for a large number of cells (e.g., 100-100,000 cells) a complex n-dimensional scattered data set may be generated.[00679]    Statistical methods may be used for clustering cells into individual separate populations in this n-dimensional space. These methods may also use state-of-the-art knowledge from cell biology and hematology to aid in clustering and cell population identification.[00680]    Figure 125 provides an example of multi-parameter acquisition of data from labeled cell samples. IIuman leukocytes were labeled with the pan-leukocyte marker anti-CD45-Alexa Fluor 700 (shown here in green) and the B-cell marker anti-CD22-APC (shown here in red). The individual channels show different patterns of CD45, CD22 expression and side scatter. Cells which are positive for CD22 and CD45 (B-lymphocytes) show the characteristically low side scatter. On the other hand cells such as neutrophils and cosinophils which have high side scatter do not show labeling for CD22.[00681]    Figure 127 provides an example of quantitative multi-parametric data acquisition and analysis. For example, a histrogram may be provided which may show distribution of CD45 intensity on human leukocytes. Any other graphical data distribution techniques may be employed to shows the distribution. In ;A 028251962013.07-18 some embodiments, a scatter plot of side scatter may be provided. The side scatter may be determined by dark-field image analysis versus CD45 fluorescence intensity for a human leukocyte sample. The side scatter plot may show two main populations of granulocytes (top left) and lymphocytes (bottom right).[00682]    Foregoing sections describe the main components and capabilities of the cytometry platform and applications. Based on these capabilities, a wide gamut of cell-based assays can be designed to work on this platform. For example, an assay for performing a 5-part leukocyte differential may be provided. The reportables in this case may be number of cells per microliter of blood for the following types of leukocytes: monocytes, lymphocytes, neutrophils, basophils and eosinophils. The basic strategy for development of this assay on the cytometry platform may be to convert this into a problem where some attributes of leukocytes are measured such as side scatter, CD45 fluorescence intensity, or CD20 fluorescence intensity so that leukocytes can be segregated into (e.g., 5) different populations in this n-dimensional space. The regions made around a cluster of cells can be positioned on a scatter plot in 2-dimensional space are called \"gates\" after flow cytometry parlance. An example labeling and \"gating\" strategy is as follows:Marker                Label          Purpose CD2/CRTH2/CD19/CD3 cocktail PE-Cy7    Identification of lymphocytes, labeling o basophils and eosinophils CD45                  Alexa-Fluor 647    Pan-leukocyte marker to label all leukocytes CD14/CD36 cocktail    FITC           Identification of monocytes Cell type      \"Gate\"Basophils      CD2/CRTH2/CD19/CD3 pos, SSC low, CD45 intermediate, CD14/CD36 low Eosinophils    CD2/CRTH2/CD19/CD3 pos, SSC high, CD45 high, CD14/CD36 low Neutrophils    CD2/CRTH2/CD19/CD3 neg, SSC high, CD45 intermediate (less Fosinopils) Lymphocytes    CD2/CRTH2/CD19/CD3 pos, SSC low, CD45 high, CD14/CD36 low Monocytes      CD2/CRTII2/CD19/CD3 ncg, SSC int, CD45 int, CD14/CD36 pos [00683]    The cytometry platform and analysis system described herein may advantageously permit automated sample preparation and execution based on ordered sample. The systems and methods described may also enable specific identification of cells as opposed to VCS (volume, conductivity and scatter), which can increase confidence in identification and reduce instances for confirmatory testing. The image analysis described herein may also permit preservation of cell images for later confirmation, analysis as required. There may also advantageously be availability of morphological features of the cell. In some embodiments, dynamic adjustment of sample prep and imaging parameters to deal with cell samples of wide range of concentrations may be provided.[00684]    In some embodiments, the centrifuge may be used to prepare and concentrate cell populations. A method may include the use of the centrifuge for cell preparation and the imaging and analysis system described elsewhere herein.   ;A 028251962013-07-18 [00685]    In some embodiments, a combination of dark-field imaging and imaging of cells stained with multiple fluorescent antibodies may be used. Such a combination may give the equivalent of FACS analysis in a much simpler and less expensive device than other techniques.[00686]    In accordance with some embodiments of the invention, the systems and methods described herein may enable one or more of the following features. Such features may be advantageous for various applications. In some embodiments, automated sample inspection and processing may be enabled. Such sample inspection and processing may include one or more of the following: sample quality, sample volume measurement, dilution (and measurement of dilution factors), and separation of red and white cells from plasma.[00687]    An automated chemical/assay related process may also be employed. This may include precipitation, mixing or sedimentation.[00688]    In some embodiments, there may be automated measurement of any and all assays that produce luminescence or change light (e.g., color chemistry). These may include one or more of the following: spectrophotometry, fluorimetry, luminometry, turbidimetry, nephelometry, refractometry, 3-color image analysis, polarimetry, measurement of agglutination, image analysis (which may employ one or more of the following: camera, digital camera, scanner, lens-less photography, 3-D photography, video photography), or microscopy.[00689]    Automated quality control and/or calibration of assays may also be provided within the systems and methods described herein.[00690]    In some embodiments, two-way communication may be provided. Such communication may enable record keeping of all assay steps. The two-way communication may also enable changes in assay protocols to optimize or increase completion of multiple assays.[00691]    Quality Control/Complementary Applications [00692]    In some embodiments, imaging may be used in conjunction with one or more other measurements or detection steps. The imaging may be complementary to other techniques, procedures, reactions, and/or assays. For example, imaging may be used to perform one or more quality control check or step for any other action, such as a sample preparation, assay, or detection step. Imaging may be used for the facilitation of other detections. Imaging may be used to improve the accuracy and/or precision of collected data. The imaging may be a quality control aspect to verify data, results, and/or any measurements. The imaging may be a control mechanism or improvement mechanism. Imaging may be used to detect one or more condition that may affect collected data and/or the accuracy and/or precision of the data. Thus, imaging may improve sample preparation, assay, and/or detection procedures. This may be particularly advantageous in situations where there are small sample volumes, such as volumes described elsewhere herein.[00693]    In an example, a detection step may occur to determine the presence and/or concentration of an analyte. Detection may occur of one or more signal that may be representative of data that may be useful for subsequent qualitative and/or quantitative evaluation. Detection may or may not include the detection of visible light. Detection may include the measurement of energy from anywhere along the electromagnetic spectrum (e.g., infra-red, microwave, ultraviolet, gamma ray, x-ray, visible light). Detection may occur using any type of sensor, which may include an optical sensor, temperature sensor, motion sensor, pressure sensor, electricity sensor, acoustic sensor, chemical sensor, spectrometer, or any other sensor described elsewhere herein, or any ;A 028251962013-07-18 combination thereof. In some embodiments, detection may or may not include a spatial distribution of light and/or energy. In some instances, detection may or may not include an energy density distribution.[00694]    Imaging may be capable of detecting one or more condition under which the detection takes place. Imaging may be used to detect the condition of a sample, reagent, container, portion of the device that may be used in the detection. In some embodiments, the imaging may be visible imaging. For example, imaging may include capturing a snapshot, photo, and/or picture. Imaging may include capturing a spatial distribution of energy along the electromagnetic spectrum. The energy along the electromagnetic spectrum may include visible light, or may include other ranges (e.g., infra-red, ultraviolet, or any other described herein). For example, a spatial distribution of visible light may include a two-dimensional image. In some embodiments, imaging may include the use of an image capture device, which is described in greater detail elsewhere herein. Some examples of image capture devices may include a camera, such as a lens-less (computational) camera (e.g., Frankencamera) or open-source camera. An image capture device may be capable of capturing signals that may be capable of generating a one-dimensional, two-dimensional, or three-dimensional representation of the item that is imaged. In some cases, an image capture device may be a motion-sensing input device configured to provide a three-dimensional or pseudo three-dimensional representation of an object.[00695]    The imaging technique may be the same or may be different from the detection mechanism utilized. In some instances, different types of detection mechanisms are used between the detection step and the quality control imaging step. In some instances, detection may include an energy band assessment or energy density distribution, such as from a spectrometer, while quality control imaging may include a spatial distribution of visible light, such as from a camera.[00696]    Sensitive detection may be achieved by imaging. For example, an imaging device may be able to capture an image to within 1 mm, 500 micrometer (um), 200 um, 100 um, 75 um, 50 urn, 25 um, 15 um, 10 urn, 7 urn, 5 urn, 1 urn, 800 nanometer (nm), 700 nm, 500 nm, 300 nm, 100 nm, 50 nm, 30 nm, 10 nm, 5 nm, 1 nm, 500 picometer (pm), 300 pm, or 100 pm. In an example, the imaging may be achieved by a camera which may have a resolution of greater than or equal to about 2 megapixels, 4 megapixels, 6 megapixels, 8 megapixels, 10 megapixels, 12 megapixels, 15 megapixels, 20 megapixels, 25 megapixels, 30 megapixels, 40 megapixels, or 50 megapixels, or more.[00697]    Imaging may be used to detect an error or other fault state. Imaging may be used to determine a condition that may increase the likelihood of an error and/or result in inaccuracies and/or imprecision. For example, imaging may be used to determine the presence and/or absence of one or more undesirable materials. Examples of undesirable materials may include bubbles, particles, fibers, particulates, debris, precipitates, or other material that may affect a measurement. In another example imaging may be used to determine if a volume of sample, reagent, or other material falls within a desired range, or whether a sample, reagent, or other material is located in a desired location. The imaging may be used to determine the concentration of a sample, reagent or other material, or whether the sample, reagent, or other material falls into a desired concentration range.[00698]    In one example, an enzymatic assay may be performed on a small volume of sample. Examples of volume values may be provided elsewhere herein. A spectrometer or other detection method or mechanism described herein may be used to perform a detection step for the enzymatic assay. An imaging step may occur to determine the conditions under which the detection is occurring. For example, the imaging step may ;A 028251962013-07-18 determine whether there arc undesired particulates, such as bubbles, or any other undesired conditions. Thc imaging step may verify whether the assay is operating as it should. The imaging step may confirm whether the operating conditions under which the assay is occurring and/or detection is being performed falls within desired tolerances or optimized conditions. In some examples, the imaging may include taking a snapshot of a reaction occurring in a container. The captured image may be analyzed for any undesirable and/or desirable conditions. In some instances, the captured image may be analyzed automatically in a computer assisted method. One or more processor may aid with the analysis of the captured image, in some cases using one or more routines implemented by way of machine-executable code stored in a memory location. The imaging may be used for quality control without requiring the intervention of a human.[00699]    The imaging may provide intelligence for a system. The imaging step may provide intelligence on the conditions under which sample preparation, assay, and/or detection occurs. The detection methods may provide more reliable, accurate, and/or precise measurements from a point of service device or component of the device, when utilizing the imaging in a quality control procedure. The quality control may be beneficial when small volumes are utilized.[00700]    Dynamic Feedback [00701]    In some embodiments, dynamic feedback may be provided during a sample processing step. For example, dynamic feedback may occur during a sample preparation step, assay step, and/or detection step. In some embodiments, dynamic feedback may be provided via imaging. Alternatively, dynamic feedback may occur via any other detection mechanism, such as those described elsewhere herein. In some embodiments, a dynamic feedback mechanism may utilize optical detection, clectromechanics, impedance, electrochemistry, microfluidics, or any other mechanism or combination thereof.[00702]    Dynamic feedback may optionally utilize imaging or other detection mechanisms. The dynamic feedback may be involved in automated decision making for a system. For example, an image may be captured, and data may be captured that may be considered in the determination of a step. A sensor, such as an imaging sensor, may capture physical information which may be utilized in the determination of a subsequent step or procedure. Such subsequent steps or procedures may be determined on the fly in an automated fashion.[00703]    In an example, dynamic dilution may occur. A container, such as a cuvette or any other container described herein, may have a sample therein. A dynamic feedback mechanism (e.g., imaging, spectrophotometer, or other detection mechanism) may determine the concentration of a sample. In some embodiments, the determination may be a rough or crude determination. The initial determination may be a ballpark determination that may provide feedback that may put the sample into a condition for more precise or fine-tuned detection and/or analysis. In an example, the dynamic feedback mechanism may be an imaging method that may use an initial fluorescence detection to do the initial estimate for concentration.[00704]    The dynamic feedback mechanism may determine whether the sample concentration falls within an acceptable range. In one example, the concentration may be a cell concentration. A rough cell count may be performed to determine cell concentration. One or more signal from the dynamic feedback mechanism may be used for the cell count. In some embodiments, cells may be provided in a wide range of concentrations. In some instances, the concentrations may vary on over 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or more orders of magnitude. In some embodiments, depending on the cell or analyte to be measured and/or analyzed, different concentrations may be provided within the same sample. Based on the determined concentration, the sample may be diluted or ;A 028251962013-07-18 concentrated and/or amplified. For example, if the concentration is higher than a desired range, thc sample may be diluted. If the concentration is lower than a desired range, the sample may be concentrated and/or amplified. The degree of dilution and/or concentration/amplification may be determined on the fly, based on the estimated concentration.[00705]    The degree of dilution and/or concentration/amplification may be determined in an automated fashion. Dynamic feedback may be automated. The dynamic feedback mechanism (e.g., imaging or other detection mechanism) may provide data which may be analyzed to determine an operational condition. For example, a sample concentration may be determined based on the dynamic feedback mechanism. A processor may be provided, capable of receiving and/or processing one or more signals from the dynamic feedback mechanism. Based on the received signals the processor may determine the concentration and whether the concentration falls within a desired range. If the concentration falls within the desired range, the processor may determine that no further dilution or concentration/amplification is needed. If the concentration is higher than the desired range, the processor may determine that dilution is needed. The processor may determine the degree of dilution needed based on how far the concentration falls outside the desired range. If the concentration is lower than the desired range, the processor may determine that concentration (or amplification) is needed. The processor may determine the degree of amplification needed based on how far the concentration falls below the desired range. Such determinations may be based on tangible computer readable media which may include code, logic, or instructions for performing one or more steps. Such determinations may be automated and thus made without requiring the intervention of a -human. This may apply to any operational condition, and need not be limited to sample concentration, such as cell concentration.[00706]    In some embodiments, after an initial feedback measurement and dilution or concentration/amplification step, a more precise measurement may be taken. For example, a more precise measurement of cell counting may occur afier the sample is determined to be in a desirable range. In some embodiments, a sample may reach a desirable range after a single dilution and/or concentration/amplification step. In other embodiments, additional feedback steps may occur and additional dilution and/or concentration/amplification steps may be provided, as necessary. For example, if an initial determination yields that a sample has a high concentration, a dilution step may occur. Following the dilution step, an additional feedback step may optionally occur. If the sample concentration does not fall into the desired (or otherwise predetermined) range, an additional dilution or concentration/amplification step may occur, depending on whether the measured concentration is above or below the desired range, respectively. This may be repeated as many times as necessary for the sample to fall into the desired range. Alternatively, feedback steps may or may not be repeated, or may be repeated a fixed number of times. In some embodiments, each feedback step may occur with a greater degree of precision. Alternatively, the same degree of precision may be utilized in each of the feedback steps.[00707]    In some embodiments, when a sample concentration (e.g., cell concentration, analyte concentration) falls into a desired range, the sample may be analyzed effectively. For example, the sample cell concentration may have a desired range that may be beneficial for imaging. A desired number of cells per field of view may be provided.[00708]    Cell quantification and enumeration by imaging can enhanced by controlling the cells density during imaging, thus limiting crowding and clustering of cells. Consequently the range of analyte concentration ;A 028251962013-07-18 over which the assay is linear can bc maximized or increased. In order to extend thc assay linear range, the dynamic system may perform a prior, non-destructive measurement on the sample using a method which has a high dynamic range to provide determine a rough cell concentration in the sample. An algorithm may then calculate the dilution ratio required to bring the cell concentration in the acceptable range for the main measurement. Dilution and/or concentration/amplification may be provided accordingly, thereby providing dynamic dilution and/or concentration.[00709]    Such dynamic feedback, such as dynamic dilution, may be advantageous in systems utilizing small volumes. In some embodiments, a total sample volume may include any of the volumes described elsewhere herein. In some instances, the volumes for a particular portion of a sample to be analyzed may have any of the volumes described elsewhere herein. Dynamic dilution may assist with providing low coefficient of variation. For example, a coefficient of variation for a sample preparation, assay, and/or detection step may have a coefficient of variation value as described elsewhere herein. This may be advantageous in point of service devices, which may utilize small volumes, and/or have low coefficients of variation.[00710]    Dynamic feedback may advantageously permit non-destructive testing of a sample. This may be advantageous in systems using small volumes. The same sample may be used for the initial feedback detection and for subsequent detections. The same sample may under initial feedback detection and subsequent detections within the same container (e.g., cuvette, vial, tip). A vessel may be provided with a sample that is outside a desired and/or detectable range iTI its initial state. For example, a concentration or one OT more analytes and/or cells may fall outside a desired and/or detectable concentration range initially. The same sample may be measured within the range in the same vessel. In some embodiments, the concentration of the one or more analytcs and/or cells may later fall within a desired and/or detectable range in the same vessel. In some embodiments, one or more intervening steps, such as dilution and/or concentration/amplification may be performed on the sample in order to get the sample into the desired and/or detectable range. Such intervening steps may be performed in an automated fashion.[00711]    In some embodiments, dilution may be provided to the sample in an automated fashion. For example, a diluent may be dispensed into a container holding the sample and mixed with the sample to effect a new sample volume. In some cases, the diluent includes a single diluent. In other cases, the diluent includes a plurality of diluents. The diluent can be dispensed into the container with the aid of a pumping system, valves and/or fluid flow channels for facilitating the flow, such as a microfluidic system having one or more microfluidic channels and/or one or more microfluidic pumps. The microfluidic system may include one or more mechanical and/or electromechanical components, such as a mechanical pumping system having one or more actuated (e.g., pneumatically actuated) valves for facilitating the flow of a fluid. The pumping system in some cases includes a mechanical pump configured to facilitate fluid flow. The pumping system can include one or more sensors for measuring and relaying operating parameters, such as fluid flow rate, concentration, temperature and/or pressure, to a control system. In an example, the diluent is dispensed into the container with the aid of a microfluidic system having a mechanical pump coupled to a microfluidic channel bringing the container in fluid communication with a diluent reservoir.[00712]    In some cases, a pumping system is provided to release a diluent based on a measured sample dilution. The sample dilution can be measured with the aid of a sensor, such as, for example, a light sensor. In an example, the light sensor is coupled with a light source for directing a beam of light through the sample, and ;A 028251962013-07-18 subsequently measuring sample dilution bascd at least in part on the scattering of light through thc sample. If the measured sample (e.g., cell, tissue) concentration is above a predetermined limit (or threshold), then the pumping system directs a diluent (e.g., water) from a diluent reservoir to a container holding the sample.[00713]    In some embodiments, dynamic dilution is electronically automated with the aid of a fluid flow system having a pump (e.g., microfluidic pump) in fluid communication with a fluid flow channel (e.g., microfluidic channel), and further including one or more valves for regulating fluid flow. The automation of dilution can be used to test and/or adjust calibration settings, such as preset dilution fluid volumes used to effect a desired concentration.[00714]    In sonic situations, the pump comprises one or more valves, such as pneumatically-actuated valves. The pump, fluid flow channel and one or more valves bring a diluent reservoir in fluid communication with a container configured to hold a sample. The one or more valves and/or the pump can be in electrical communication with a control system having a processor for regulating the flow of diluent from the diluent reservoir to the to regulate the concentration of the sample.[00715]    Dynamic feedback advantageously enables the automated regulation of sample concentration while minimizing, if not eliminating, user involvement. In some cases, the concentration of a sample is automatically regulated (e.g., diluted or amplified) without any user involvement. Such minimal user involvement can provide low coefficient of variation in imaging and overall system use, as described elsewhere herein.[00716]    In an example, dynamic feedback system is used to regulate the concentration of cells in a fluid sample using imaging. With the sample provided in a sample container, such as cuvette, the imaging is used to measure the concentration of cells in the fluid sample. The measured concentration can be a rough (or ballpark) measurement of concentration. The dynamic feedback system then dilutes the fluid sample by providing a diluent into the sample container. This may minimize, if not eliminate, any disturbance to (or destruction of) the cells upon dilution. An optional measurement of the concentration of cells in the fluid sample can then be made to measure the concentration following dilution. In sonic situations, following dilution a reaction can take place in the same sample container that was used to dilute the sample. In some situations, the reaction may take place in cases in which the dilution is not optimal.[00717]    In some cases, during dynamic feedback a rough measurement of sample concentration is made with the aid of a spectrometer, and a more precise measurement of sample concentration is made with the aid of an imaging device. The imaging device can include a light source (e.g., coherent light, such as a laser, or incoherent light) and a camera, such as a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera. In an example, following the rough measurement, the dynamic feedback system coarse adjusts the concentration of the sample by providing the diluent, and subsequently makes the more precise measurement. The sample concentration can be further adjusted by providing smaller volumes of a diluent (i.e., fine adjustment) in relation to the volume of the diluent provided during coarse adjustment. Alternatively, the rough measurement of sample concentration is made with the aid of an imaging device, and the more precise measurement is made with the aid of a spectrometer. Coarse and fine adjustment [00718]    Dynamic feedback systems provided herein can be configured to concentrate/amplify (i.e., increase the concentration of) a sample, such as cells in a fluid sample. In some cases, this is accomplished with the aid of centrifugation or field-induced separation (e.g., electric field separation, magnetic separation).   ;A 028251962013-07-18 [00719]    In some situations, the concentration of a sample is made using an imaging device, with the location of the imaging device selected to select a desired path length and/or focal point. In some cases, the location of one or more optics associated with the imaging device are adjusted to provide a desired path length and/or focal point. In some cases, a lens-less camera is used for image capture, which can computationally provide image analysis and various focal points.[00720]    Dynamic dilution can be performed on various sample volumes. In some cases, if a sample volume is above a predetermined limit, the sample can be distributed in multiple sample containers (e.g., cuvettes) for sequential or parallel processing and/or imaging.Self-Learning [00721]    The dynamic feedback mechanism may result in self-learning by the system. For example, for a dynamic dilution/concentration system, an initial feedback measurement may be made. Based on the feedback measurement, the sample may have no action, may be diluted, or may be concentrated/amplified. Subsequent measurements and/or detection may occur. The subsequent measurements and/or detection may or may not be additional feedback measurements. Based on the subsequent measurements, a determination may be made whether the action taken (e.g., no action, dilution, concentration/amplification) was correct and/or whether the correct degree of action was taken (e.g., enough dilution or concentration/amplification). For example, an initial feedback mechanism may determine that the sample concentration is high and needs to be diluted. The sample may be diluted by a particular amount. A subsequent measurement may be taken (e.g., image of the sample may be taken). If the degree of dilution does not bring the sample into the desired range (e.g., dilution was too much or too little), the system may receive an indication that for subsequent dynamic dilutions/concentrations with the same or similar initial feedback mechanisms, a different degree of dilution may be used. If the degree of dilution does bring the sample into the desired range, the system may receive a confirmation that the amount of dilution should be used for subsequent dilutions for the same or similar type of initial feedback measurement.[00722]    Data points may be gathered based on initial conditions and subsequent actions, which may assist with determining appropriate actions to take in subsequent dynamic feedback situations. This may cause the system to self-learn over time on steps to take in particular dynamic situations. The self-learning may apply to individualized situations. For example, the self-learning system may learn that a particular individual from whom the sample is drawn, may require different degrees of dilution/concentration than another individual. The self-learning may apply to groups of individuals having one or more characteristic. For example, the self-learning system may learn that an individual using a particular type of drug may require different degrees of dilution/concentration than another individual. The self-learning system may also be generalized. For example, the system may become aware of a pattern that people of a particular demographic or having particular characteristics may or may not required different degrees of dilution and/or concentration. The system may draw on past data points, individuals' records, other individuals' records, general health information, public information, medical data and statistics, insurance information, or other information. Some of the information may be publicly available on the Internet (e.g., web sites, articles, journals, databases, medical statistics). The system may optionally crawl web sites or databases for updates to information. In some embodiments, self-learning may occur on the device, the cloud or an external device. As additional data is gathered, it may be uploaded to the cloud or external device, and may be accessible by the self-learning system.   ;A 028251962013-07-18 Image capture and/or manipulation devices [00723]    In some embodiments, sample preparation, processing and/or analysis is performed with the aid of image capture and/or manipulation devices, including electromagnetic radiation (or light) capture and/or manipulation devices, such as imaging devices or spectrometers. In some cases, an imaging device can be used in association with a spectrometer. A spectrometer can be used to measure properties of light over a select portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, which may be used for spectroscopic analysis, such as materials analysis. An imaging (or image capture) device can be used to measure sample concentration, composition, temperature, turbidity, flow rate, and/or viscosity.[00724]    In an example, an image capture device may be a digital camera. Image capture devices may also include charge coupled devices (CCDs) or photomultipliers and phototubes, or photodetector or other detection device such as a scanning microscope, whether back-lit or forward-lit. In some instances, cameras may use CCDs, CMOS, may be lens-less (computational) cameras (e.g., Frankcncamera), open-source cameras, or may use any other visual detection technology known in the art. In some instances, an imaging device may include an optical element that may be a lens. For example, the optical element is a lens which captures light from the focal plane of a lens on the detector. Cameras may include one or more optical elements that may focus light during use, or may capture images that can be later focused. In some embodiments, imaging devices may employ 2-d imaging, 3-d imaging, and/or 4-d imaging (incorporating changes over time). Imaging devices may capture static images or dynamic images (e.g., video). The static images may be captured at one or inure points in time. The imaging devices may also capture video and/or dynamic images. The video images may be captured continuously over one or more periods of time.[00725]    In some cases, an image capture device is a computational camera that is used to measure the concentration of a plurality of samples within a relatively short period of time, such as at once. In some embodiments, the computational camera may have an optical which may be different from a lens. In an example, the computation cameral is a lens-less camera that takes a photograph of a plurality of samples in staggered sample containers (e.g., cuvettes). The concentration of a sample in a particular sample container can then be calculated by, for example, mathematically rendering the image to select a focal point at or adjacent to a portion of the image having the particular sample container, and deriving the sample concentration from the rendered image. Such mathematical manipulation of an image, as may be acquired with the aid of a lens-less camera, can provide other information at various points in space within the field of view of the lens-less camera, which may include points in space that may be extrapolated from scattered light. In some embodiments, the final signal may be analyzed by complex algorithms. One example of such a setup is a computational camera with optical elements which may produce a Fourier-transformed image on the detector. The resulting \"image\" can be analyzed to extract required information. Such a detector would enable one to obtain rich information from the imaged subject. Obtaining different features from the image, for example, information at a different focal length could be done purely through software, simplifying the imaging hardware and providing -more rapid and informative data acquisition.[00726]    Electromagnetic radiation capture and/or manipulation devices can be used in various applications provided herein, such as measuring sample concentration, including dynamic dilution. In an example, a light capture and/or manipulation device includes a light source, such as a coherent light source (e.g., laser), coupled with a light sensor, such as a CCD camera, for capturing scattered light, as may emanate from a sample upon the ;A 028251962013.07-18 light source being directed through the sample. This can be used to measure the concentration of the sample. The light sensor can be configured to capture (or sense) various wavelengths of light, such as red, green and blue, or other color combinations, such as combinations of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet, to name a few examples. In some situations, the light sensor is configured to sense light having wavelengths at or greater than infrared or near infrared, or less than or equal to ultraviolet, in addition to the visible spectrum of light.[00727]    Light capture and/or manipulation devices can be used to collect information at particular points in time, or at various points in time, which may be used to construct videos having a plurality of still images and/or sound (or other data, such as textual data) associated with the images.[00728]    Light capture and/or manipulation devices, including computational (or lens-less) cameras, can be used to capture two-dimensional images or three-dimensional (or pseudo three-dimensional) images and/or video.[00729]    In some embodiments, an image capture and/or manipulation device perturbs an object and measures a response in view of the perturbation. The perturbation can be by way of light (e.g., x-rays, ultraviolet light), sound, an electromagnetic field, an electrostatic field, or combinations thereof For example, perturbation by sound can be used in acoustic imaging. Acoustic imaging may use similar principles to diagnostic ultrasound used in medicine. Acoustic imaging may function similarly to a regular microscope but may use acoustic waves. A source of ultrasound may produce waves that can travel through the sample and get reflected/scattered due to heterogeneities in the elastic properties of the sample. The reflected waves may be \"imaged\" by a sensor. A variant of this method may include \"photo-acoustic imaging\" where the acoustic waves traveling through the sample may cause local compression and extension of the sample. This compression/extension may cause a change in the refractive index of the sample material which can be detected by measuring/imaging the reflection of a laser beam by the sample.[00730]    In some situations, an imaging device can be used to measuring the volume of a cell. In an example, the combination of a light source and CCD camera is used to capture a still image of a cell. A computer system digitizes the still image and draws a line across the cell, such as through the center of the cell. The computer system then measures the distance between the points at which the line intersects the boundaries of the cell (or cell wall or membrane) to provide an estimate of the diameter of the cell, which may be used to estimate the volume of the cell.[00731]    The imaging device may utilize line scanning microscopy to enable sample illumination with a thin line or spot of coherent laser light, so that power from the source can be concentrated in a small area giving high power densities. The detector geometry may be matched with the line or spot. Then the line/spot may be scanned across the sample so that different parts of it can be imaged. Each scanned line can then be concatenated to form the whole image (e.g., in a similar manner like a document scanner). This method may be advantageous as an analytical/imaging method for one or more of the following reasons: (1) high power density of illumination, (2) relatively high speeds can be obtained from line scanning as opposed to spot scanning, (though both may be slower than full-frame or classical imaging), (3) high precision and/or accuracy of analytical measurements on the sample such as fluorescence, absorbance, luminescence, (4) combination with spectral or hyper-spectral imaging such that a complete spectrum of the sample can be acquired for each pixel, ;A 028251962013-07-18 (5) on-the-fly adjustment of resolution, (i.e. without changing any elements, a sample can be scanned at low or high lateral resolution as desired), or (6) can provide high depth of field to allow imaging of tissue samples.[00732]    In some embodiments, an imaging device is configured to detect light emanating from an ionization (fluorescence or luminescence) event, such as via scintillation. In an example, a scintillator is coated on or embedded in a material comprising a sample container. Upon a sample binding to (or otherwise interacting with the scintillator), the scintillator emanates light (e.g., fluorescent light) that is detected by a detector of the imaging device. This may be used to measure the radioactive decay (e.g., alpha and/or beta decay) of certain samples.[00733]    Tn some situations, an imaging device is a field effect transistor for detecting charged particles, such as ions. Alternatively, the imaging device may be a thermal detector for measuring a heat change, which may be used to construct a heat map, for example.[00734]    In some situations, a sample container comprises one or more wells for immobilizing a sample. The sample container may be coupled with an imaging device for imaging a sample immobilized in the one or more wells. Sample immobilization can be facilitated with the aid of beads having surface binding agents (e.g., antibodies) or surface binding agents, which may be disposed, for example, at bottom portions of wells. The wells can have diameters on the order of nanometers to micrometers or greater.[00735]    In some embodiments, sample detection and/or analysis is facilitated with the aid of image enhancement species, such as dyes. A dye may bind to a sample provide an optical, electrical or optoetectronic signal that can be detected by a detector of an imaging device. In an example, a dye binds to a cell and fluoresces, which is recorded by a detector. By measuring fluorescence, the spatial distribution and/or concentration of cells can be measured. Image enhancement species can aid in achieving improved signal-to-noise during image acquisition (or capture). A dye can bind to a cell with the aid of surface receptors and/or antibodies.[00736]    in some cases, the use of dyes can generate background fluorescence, which may distort an image ______________________________________________________________ the fluorescence sample may be difficult to resolve from the fluorescing background. In such a case, image acquisition can be enhanced by contacting a sample in a fluid with a fluorescent dye. Unbound dye is removed with the aid of a centrifuge (or magnetic or electric separation), which separates the sample from the unbound dye. The centrifuge may be integrated in a point of service device having the imaging device. The sample can then be re-suspended in a fluid and subsequently imaged with the aid of the imaging device.[00737]    In some cases, image acquisition can be enhanced by using dynamic feedback in addition to, or in place of, the use of image enhancement species. In an example, the concentration of the sample is optimized with the aid of dilution and/or amplification prior to image acquisition.[00738]    Sample separation can be facilitated with the aid of a centrifuge. As an alternative, sample separation can be performed with the aid of a magnetic or electric field. For instance, a magnetic particle can bind to a cell, which in the presence of a magnetic field can be used to attract the cell towards the source of magnetic attraction.[00739]    Systems and methods provided herein can be applied to various types of samples, such as cells as may be derived from tissue (e.g., skin, blood), saliva or urine. In an example, dynamic feedback and/or imaging can be applied to tissue samples or cell samples derived from such tissue samples.   ;A 028251962013.07-18 Examples Example 1: Nucleic acid amplification by Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) [00740]    To evaluate the ability of the three-color image analysis method for both fluorescence and absorption to read LAMP assays the following experiments were performed.[00741]    Lamp Reaction Conditions [00742]    The LAMP reaction was carried out in a total volume of 25  IL in 500 uL PCR tubes (VWR, West Chester, PA). The reaction mixture included 0.8 hM of primer 1 and primer 2, 0.2 hM of primer 3 and primer 4, 400 tiM each dl\\TTP (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 1M betaine (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), 1X Thermopol Buffer (New England Biolabs, Ipswitch, MA), 2 mM MgSO4 (Rockland Immunochemicals, Gilbertsville, PA), 8U Bst DNA polymerase large fragment (New England Biolabs, Ipsw-itch, MA), and a given amount of template DNA (varied between ¨10 and ¨10^9 copies). In the case of negative control approximately 10\"9 copies of irrelevant DNA was added.[00743]    Reaction Conditions [00744]    The reaction was incubated at 65  C for 1 hour in sealed tubes. The polymerase was then inactivated by heating the reaction product to 80  C for 5 minutes.[00745]    Product Detection and Visualization [00746]    SYBR Green I stain (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) stock was diluted 100 fold, 5 pi was mixed with lOhL of the completed LAMP reaction product mixed, and incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature. The reaction products were then read out in the following way:[00747]    Fluorescence readout: PCR tubes or pipette tips containing the mixture, were illuminated with 302 nm UV light and fluorescent emission (2Lmax ¨ 524 nm) imaged by a digital camera (Canon EOS Tli, 18-55 mm, Canon, Lake Success, NY).[00748]    Color readout: Reaction products were aspirated into tips and imaged using a digital camera [00749]    Results:[00750]    A fluorescence image of assay products in tubes is shown in Figure 81.[00751]    A fluorescence image of the assay product in tips is shown in Figure 89.[00752]    Color images of the assay products in tips are shown in Figure 82, Figure 83, Figure 84, Figure 85, Figure 86, and Figure 87, Figure 88 shows a background color image obtained for calibration.[00753]    Figure 90 shows a comparison of LAMP dose-responses obtained by measurement of \"bulk\" fluorescence (conventional fluorometry) and responses for two color channels obtained by camera. As is evident, the color method shows a response comparable to that of fluorimetry.[00754]    When the color images were analyzed and calibrated according to methods described herein using all thee color channels, the close correspondence of the calibrated color signal with the fluorescence signal is evident as shown in Figure 91.Example 2: System maximizing sample utilization [00755]    A system for maximizing sample utilization can have the following characteristics:[00756]    1. Efficient separation of blood into plasma and efficient recovery of the plasma [00757]    a. Separation is achieved by centrifugation in a capillary tube ;A 028251962013-07-18 [00758]    2. Dilution of the plasma to a few pre-established levels appropriate to both high and low sensitivity assays [00759]    3. Minimizing the volume of each assay reaction mixture required for each assay [00760]    a. Using an open-ended low volume cuvette suitable for assay incubations while precluding evaporation [00761]      i. Cuvette is long relative to width [00762]    b. Within said low volume cuvettes enabling increase in assay signal sensitivity by modifying the optical pathlength [00763]      i. Cuvette is conical or has features where the width is wide and narrow [00764]    c. When needed, achieving said increase in assay signal sensitivity by moving the reaction product (which does not fill the cuvette) to selected locations having greater pathlength at the time of optical measurement [00765]      i. Cuvette internal volume is much larger than the volume of the assay mixture [00766]    4. Use of either or both variable pathlength and 3-color channel analysis to increase the useful dynamic range of assays Example 3: Point-of-care assay device [00767]    A point of care assay device can include of single-use disposable cartridges an instrument which processes samples and operates the assays and a server remote from the instrument, the measurement and detection system comprising:[00768]    = A disposable cartridge containing [00769]    -    Sample-acquisition and metering methods (such as a sample tip) [00770]    = An instrument housing containing [00771]    - A light imaging sensor (such as a cell-phone camera having a light source (e.g., a flash) and a CCD image collecting device) [00772]    - A mechanism for moving said tip to a location where said light imaging sensor can acquire images [00773]    = Uploading said images wirelessly (or by other methods) to a server remote from the instrument [00774]    = Image interpreting software capable of:[00775]    - Measuring volumes from the two-dimensional images [00776]    - Distinguishing sample types [00777]    = Using said sample type and/or volume data as part of an operating algorithm to:[00778]    - Provide prompts to system users as to sample integrity [00779]    - Provide any needed prompts to provide an augmented or replacement sample [00780]    - Interpret signal data from said instrument in terms of assay results making allowance for sample type and/or sample volume [00781]    The system can optionally include additional mechanisms for processing and/or imaging of samples acquired by users into a \"sample acquisition device (capillary)\" comprising:   ;A 028251962013-07-18 [00782]    =    Mechanisms for accepting the capillary in a defined location and moving said capillary to another defined location where an image can be acquired [00783]    = Mechanisms for ejecting substantially all the sample into the said cartridge at a defined location Example 4: Analysis of a capillary containing a blood sample [00784]    Samples are acquired by users by touching the distal end of the capillary to a drop of blood (typically as a fingerstick). The capillary usually fills by capillary action provided there is sufficient blood. In one version of the invention, the user places the capillary at a latching location on the cartridge then inserts the cartridge onto a slide in the instrument then activates an assay by pressing a screen button on the instrument GUI. All subsequent assay steps are automated. The instrument moves the cartridge inside its housing and closes the door through which the cartridge was inserted. In this version of the invention, the instrument moves a component for grasping the capillary and moving it to a location in front of a digital camera equipped with a flash light source a CCD. An image of the capillary is taken using flash illumination and sent wirelessly to the server which interprets the image in terms of type, location and quantity of sample. If preset criteria are met the server instructs the instrument to continue the assay. If the sample is not appropriate the capillary is returned to the cartridge which is ejected and the server causes the GUI to display an appropriate prompt. The user may then (1) add more sample or (2) obtain a fresh sample and use a new capillary. Once the user indicates by the GUI that corrective action has been taken and the capillary/cartridge has been re-inserted into the instrument, the server instructs the instrument to resume assay processing. The criterion for appropriate volume of sample is usually that the volume is more than the minimum required for the assay. Thus in some assays for example, 10 uL of sample can be used, so typically the sample is regarded as adequate if the measured volume is > 12 uL.[00785]    In a second version of the invention which may be implemented alone or in combination with the first, image acquisition is used to measure the volume of sample taken from the original sample by the instrument. In the assay sequence, sample is ejected from the capillary into a sample well in the cartridge either (1) by the user, or (2) by the instrument. Then an exact volume is taken from sample well using a second tip either by capillary action or (preferred) pneumatic methods. At this stage the type of the sub-sample and the sub-sample volume is measured (as above) by imaging the tip. If the sample type and volume is acceptable (target +/- < 5%), the assay proceeds. If not, the assay may be aborted and the user prompted to take remedial action. Sample types that may be discriminated are blood and plasma or serum and others. The imaging system makes the distinction by observing the much greater contrast between blood (opaque) and the tip (transparent) than is the case for plasma and serum. In the event that the sample volume while not at the target level is still sufficient for the assay to give satisfactory results (in the above example, a volume > 5 uL would be acceptable if the target volume is 10 uL). The assay algorithm that calculates the analyte concentration then uses a correction function Conc. (true) = Conc. (observed assuming target volume)*Target volume/Measured volume.[00786]    Blood can easily be detected and its volume measured by creating a pixel map of the tip and counting the dark pixels then comparing with a previously established number for the target volume. Even though sample types serum and plasma (and other aqueous non-blood samples) are transparent, the imaging system can still detect the presence of sample due to the change in refraction that occurs over the sample meniscus and the difference in refractive index between the tip material and the sample. Alternatively a dye ;A 028251962013-07-18 may bc added to the sample by providing a dried dye formulation coated within the capillary which is dissolved by the sample [00787]    Other methods for measuring the volume of sample include locating the top and bottom of each meniscus and using simple geometric techniques (as described herein). Bubbles within the sample liquid column can be recognized and measured by the methods discussed above and the appropriate volume subtracted from the total volume occluded by the sample.[00788]    The methods given above measure the sample within the sample capillary or pendent from the end of the capillary (as described herein). After the sample is measured and accepted by the system it is ejected by pipetting/pneumatic methods within the instrument. Once this has happened, the tip can be imaged again and any residual sample measured. The volume that actually is used in the assay is the difference between the total volume and the residual volume.[00789]    Another particular problem in POC assay systems especially when used by non-technically trained users is the presence of sample on the outside of the sample capillary.[00790]    This can be imaged and measured using the invention and the user prompted to remove excess blood.[00791]    The effectiveness of sample acquisition and delivery in assay devices depends on the liquid handling techniques used. Automated devices may use (1) pneumatic aspiration and ejection (as in many laboratory single and multi-channel pipctting devices that use disposable tips; pneumatic methods may use positive or negative pressure (vacuum)), (2) positive displacement (as in a syringe), ink jet-like technology and the like. Samples and other liquids such as reagents can be (3) drawn out of reservoirs by capillary action or (4) wicking into porous media. Liquids (samples and/or reagents) may be ejected with or without contacting other liquids. For example, if the sample is to be diluted, the sample tip can be dipped into the diluent or displaced into air so as to drop into a dry well or a well containing diluent. The performance of all of the above systems and methods may be verified and/or measured using the invention.[00792]    In other embodiments, the capillary can be imaged by a user outside the instrument with an external camera. Volume measurements can be scaled to the size of the capillary. Such an externally oriented camera can be used for recognition of the user/patient so that results can more reliably be attributed to the correct patient. The method may also be used to verify appropriate medication is being used (image the pill container or pill or alternatively the bar code reader in the instrument may be used for this purpose).[00793]    The invention may also be used to measure location and volumes of reagent aspirated into assay tips. In some cases dyes may be added to reagents to make them more easily imaged (improved contrast).[00794]    In assays where plasma is separated from blood, the invention can be used to verify the effectiveness of red cell removal and the available volume of plasma. An alternative to moving the sample containing tip is to move the camera [00795]    Such a system can have the following advantages:[00796]    1. Quantitative measurement of sample [00797]    2. Ability to identify the sample type [00798]    3. Creation of an objective, quantitative record of sample volume [00799]    4. Enables assays to give results when sample volume is not correct [00800]    5. Improves reliability of assay system ;A 028251962013-07-18 Example 5: Tips [00801]    Figure 18 shows diagrams of tips used to aspirate samples and reagents (dimensions in mm). Example 6: Geometry measurements of a cylindrical capillary [00802]    Figure 19 shows dimensions of a cylindrical capillary containing a sample.[00803]    R = radius [00804]    Li = distance from lower end of cylinder to lower sample meniscus [00805]    L2 = distance from lower end of to lower upper meniscus [00806]    Volume introduced = 7*(RA2)*(L2 - L1) Example 7: Geometry measurements of a conical capillary [00807]    Figure 20 and Figure 21 shows dimensions of a conical capillary.[00808]    Rh = radius at base of cone [00809]    L = length [00810]    L1 = distance from (projected) top of the cone to lower sample meniscus [00811]    L2 = distance from (projected) top of the cone to lower upper meniscus [00812]    Volume introduced = it (Rb/L)^2.*[(L1)A3 - (L2)^3]/3 [00813]    Tan 0 = Rb/LExample 8: Effects of liquid meniscus [00814]    As is well known, liquids in capillaries typically have a curved meniscus. Depending on the contact angle the meniscus may be curved inward or outward relative to the liquid. When no net external pressure is applied, if the capillary surface is hydrophilic (contact angle < 7/2) the meniscus is inward directed or outward directed if the surface is hydrophobic (contact angle > 7/2). When net pressure is applied to the liquid column (capillary oriented vertically or pneumatic pressure applied by the instrument) the lower meniscus can project below the lower end of the capillary. In small diameter capillaries, surface tension forces are strong relative to the small gravitational force across a meniscus. Surface tension pressure across a meniscus in a vertically oriented circular capillary is 27*R*rcos0 where y is the surface tension and 0 is the contact angle. Pressure across a meniscus caused by gravity is pgAL/(7*RA2) where p is liquid density and AL is the distance across the meniscus and g is the gravitational constant. Accordingly the meniscus surface is spherical. The volume of liquid in the segment(s) occupied by the meniscus (menisci) can be calculated as follows and used to obtain a more accurate estimate of volume.[00815]    Distances defined from the bottom of the sample capillary [00816]    Li = distance to the bottom of the lower meniscus [00817]    L2 = distance to the top of the lower meniscus [00818]    L3 = distance to the bottom of the upper meniscus [00819]    L4 = distance to the top of the upper meniscus [00820]    Volume of a spherical cap [00821]    silt(Ad' +h2)/6 [00822]    Dimensions of a spherical cap are shown in Figure 22.[00823]    Several different situations can arise defined by the number and location of the menisci. Note that the formulae given below deal with both inward and outwardly curved menisci.   ;A 028251962013-07-18 [00824]    Case 1: Upper meniscus is curved, lower is horizontal (as shown in Figure 23) [00825]    Substituting: a = R, h = L4¨ L3 [00826]    Volume between L3 and L4 = TC*( L4 L3)*(3*(R) 2   (L4¨ L)2)/6 [00827]    Total volume = it*((R2)*L3 + (L4¨ L3)*(3*(R) 2   (L4 ¨ L3) 2)/6) [00828]    Case 2: Both menisci are within the capillary and curved (as shown in Figure 24) [00829]    Total volume = it*((R2)*L3- (L2¨ LI)*(3*(R) 2   (L2¨ L1) 2)/6 + (L4¨ L3)*(3*(R) 2 + (L4¨ L3)2)/6 [00830]    Case 3: There are two curved menisci. The lower being curved and below the lower end of the capillary (as shown in Figure 25) [00831]    Total volume = 7*((R2)*143 (L i)*(3*(R) 2 + (LI 2)/6 ( L4 ¨ Li)*(3*(R) 2 + (L4 ¨ L3) 2)/6) Example 9: Bubbles [00832]    Bubbles in liquid samples or reagents cause variable reductions in volume of liquid metered. In small capillaries bubbles when smaller than the capillary cross section, arc spherical. When they arc bigger they occupy a cylindrical space (in a cylindrical capillary) and have hemispherical ends.[00833]    Case 1: Bubble is not big enough to span the width of the capillary (as shown in Figure 26) [00834]    Subtract bubble volume = (4/3)*er3 [00835]    Case 2: Bubble occludes the entire width of the capillary (as shown in Figure 27) [00836]    Subtract bubble volume = 47c*R3 + it*R2*LExample 10: Blood outside the capillary tip [00837]    Case 1: Pendant blood or reagents outside a vertical capillary can cause major problems in assays since it represents an out-of-control situation. As shown in Figure 28, imaging can easily recognize this situation.[00838]    Case 2: Blood outside the capillary other than pendant [00839]    Residual blood outside the capillary also is problematic since it is a potential source of contamination of reagents and of extra volume. Again imaging can recognize the situation. Example 11: Residual blood inside the capillary once sample dispensing has occurred [00840]    This can be dealt with by estimating the residual volume and subtracting from the total sample volume. Figure 29 shows an example o f a capillary with residual blood.[00841]    Residual volume =i-c*R2*LExample 12: Evaluation of red cell separation from blood samples [00842]    In many assays it is desirable to remove red cells from the sample thus making plasma. When this is done, it is desirable, especially in POC devices, to know that the separation was effective and to determine that there is sufficient plasma to perform the assay.[00843]    Figure 30 - Figure 39 show a schematic of one preferred embodiment of red cell removal suited to POC devices of the present invention. Magnetizable particles have antibody to red cells mixed with free antibody to red cells are provided as a dried preparation in the well that will receive a blood sample, as shown in Figure 30. When a blood sample is added to the well (shown in Figure 31) and mixed with the magnetic reagent (shown in Figure 32, Figure 33, and Figure 34), the red cells agglutinate with the magnetic particles and can be removed by placing the blood-containing well in proximity to a strong magnet (shown in Figure 35). By appropriately moving the well relative to the magnet, the red cells are separated from plasma (shown in Figure ;A 028251962013-07-18 36) which can then be ejected into a receiving well for usc in an assay (shown in Figure 37, Figure 38, and Figure 39). It is evident that the imaging analysis can determine how effectively the separation was effected and estimate the volume of plasma available for assay.Example 13: Images of liquid samples in capillaries [00844]    Figure 40 shows a high contrast image of a cylindrical tip containing a liquid with low absorbance.[00845]    Figure 41 shows an image of a conical tip containing a liquid with high absorbance.[00846]    Figure 42 shows a tip with a high absorbance liquid showing two menisci within the tip.[00847]    Figure 43 shows a tip with a sample liquid and large bubbles that span the diameter of the tip.[00848]    Figure 44 shows a tip containing water showing a clear upper meniscus in a transparent tip or capillary.[00849]    Figure 41 was analyzed for the length of the liquid column (corresponding to 5 uL) and the resolution of the upper liquid meniscus (Definition of the position of the meniscus with > 90% confidence). The precision of the meniscus location corresponded to < 1% of the length of the liquid column.Dimensions                                Pixel widths Length                                       276 Resolution of meniscus                        2 Precision                                    0.7%Example 14: Effect of insufficient sample volume on assay result [00850]    The system was used to measure Protein-C in blood. The sample volume inserted into the system was designed to be 20 uL when the sample transfer device was used properly. The instrument was set up to use lOuL of blood from this sample. The analyte concentration calculated by the system is shown in Figure 45 as the sample volume was deliberately decreased from the target level. The result was essentially constant until the sample volume was less than the volume required.Example 15: Sample transfer device [00851]    Figure 46 shows an example of a sample transfer device. The device consists of (a) a capillary (made of glass or plastic) optionally coated with an anticoagulant or other reagent suitable for pre-analytical treatment of samples, (b) a housing which holds the capillary fitted with (c) a plunger (piston) which can slide within the housing and has a raised feature which slides within a groove in the housing, (d) a groove in the housing which engages the piston feature and limits the axial motion of the plunger so that its motion stops once the sample has been displaced and (e) a vent in the housing normally open which is blocked when the plunger is activated (moved towards the distal end of the device) so as to displace any liquid in the capillary.[00852]    Figure 47 shows a sample transfer device with its capillary filled with sample. The \"fill to\" location is indicated.[00853]    Figure 48 shows a sample transfer device with sample displaced by movement of the plunger.[00854]    Figure 49 shows a sample transfer device after a sample has been incompletely ejected. Example 16: Measurement of volume by image analysis [00855]    Known volumes of a liquid sample were aspirated into sample tips using a pipetting device. Images of the tips were collected using a commercial flatbed scanner (Dell) and the distances (a) from the distal end of the tip to the meniscus and (b) from the distal end of the tip to the feature marked on the image below ;A 028251962013-07-18 measured. The orientation of the tip and its position relative to the scanner platen were not controlled since the image was analyzed by measuring the ratio of distance (a) to distance (11) as a measure of sample volume. Locations of the tip, meniscus and feature were measured using commercially imaging software (Jasc). The image was oriented horizontally using the software before the locations were recorded and could be read directly on a scale provided by the software. Figure 50 shows an exemplary image.[00856]    Distance Li was the location of the tip [00857]    Distance L2 was the location of the meniscus [00858]    Distance L3 was the location of the arrow indicated in Figure 50.Vol.       Distances in arb units                  Ratio    Calc.

The volume estimate was within less than 2% of the actual volume on average.Example 17: Images of blood centrifuged in a tip [00860]    Hematocrits were determined from digital images by measuring the ratio of length of the column of packed red cells and the total liquid column (tip to meniscus). This is easily achieved by feature recognition software which orients the tip to a known direction and counts pixels between the features. For the tips above, the distances corresponded to several hundred pixels permitting a precise measurement.[00861]    Figure 10 shows an empty capped sample tip.[00862]    Figure 11 shows a capped sample tip containing a sample of blood.[00863]    Figure 12 shows a capped sample tip containing a sample of 23% hematocrit blood after centrifugation.[00864]    Figure 13 shows a capped sample tip containing a sample of 31% hematocrit blood after centrifugation.[00865]    Figure 14 shows a capped sample tip containing a sample of 40% hematocrit blood after centrifugation.[00866]    Figure 15 shows a capped sample tip containing a sample of 52% hematocrit blood after centrifugation.[00867]    Figure 16 shows a capped sample tip containing a sample of 68% hematocrit blood after centrifugation.[00868]    Figure 17 shows a comparison of hematocrit measured using by the digitally imaging system a centrifuged sample (hematocrit,  A reported) and hematocrit measured by standard techniques (hematocrit, %   ;A 028251962013-07-18 target). An example of a standard technique of hcmatocrit measurement may include microhematocrit measurement in a glass capillary- using a standard laboratory centrifuge and measuring the length of the packed red cell bed and the total length of capillary occupied by the sample. Example 18: System including components for blood separation [00869]    A system designed for separation of blood can include the following features:[00870]    1. Design of the tip shape.[00871]    a. Aspect ratio about 20:1 length:diameter provides convenient lengths for measurement of sample, packed cell and plasma volumes [00872]    b. Shaped tips enable tight sealing with a vinyl_ cap and easy removal of cap if needed.[00873]    c. Slight draft angle conical shape of main part of tip and wider conical upper section of tip are optimal for insertion of the plasma recovery means. Note that the \"counter radial\" design (tip is narrower at the end distal to the axis of rotation) is unusual.[00874]    d. Wider conical upper section of tip is configured to be accommodated on an automated pipetting and x-y-z movement stage. Connection to form a fluid tight connection and easy removal when needed are facilitated.[00875]    2. Use of a very precise and accurate x-y-z stage to move the plasma recovery tip.[00876]    3. Use of imaging technology automatically to control the operations of centrifugation and plasma recovery. Movement of the plasma recovery tip to within less than a millimeter of the packed cell-plasma interface.Example 19: Use of image measurement of liquid volumes to improve assay calibration [00877]    Automatic pipetting devices are generally accurate and precise to about 5 % or better in the range (say) 5 50 uL. In many assays, volume accuracy and precision have both to be very good (say < 2 %) to obtain the required accuracy and precision of analytc measurement. Metering and delivery of (1) liquids at volumes less than 5 uL (highly desirable when maximum use of a small volume sample is required), and (2) liquids having \"problematic\" physical properties (such as viscous solutions, solutions containing detergents etc.) can often have poor precision and accuracy which compromises the accuracy of assay results. One inventive solution to these issues is to use image analysis of the liquids to measure the volume of liquids (samples, diluents, reagents, calibrators and controls) and then to correct the assay calibration function to allow for deviations (up to [say] 20%) from the intended volume. We have shown that in pipette tips which have very precise dimensions, volumes as small as 5 uL can be measured with very good accuracy and precision (<2%). Below we document (1) volume measurement accuracy and precision and (2) use of known relationships between the volumes of solutions used in assays (samples, reagents etc.) and assay response to correct the calibration of assays.[00878]    (1) Accuracy of volume measurement by image analysis:[00879]    In the table below, known volumes of a solution of bromphenol blue were aspirated into conical lips.[00880]    The solutions were positioned in the middle portion of the tip and imaged using a scanner. Tip orientation and position were determined by standard methods. The tip orientation was adjusted by an algorithm and the length of the liquid column measured. Using the known internal dimensions of the tip, the liquid ;A 028251962013.07-18 volume was calculated. Four replicate images were taken for four aliquots in four tips. The error given below therefore reflects image reproducibility and tip dimensional accuracy and precision.Target Measured Total volume volume Error uL                             uL     5.01    1.39 20                              19.98    1.80 [00881]    Note that the volume measurement does not rely on accurately positioning the liquid in the tip. Image analysis provides information as to the location of the liquid in the tip. Knowing the dimensions of the tip one can always compute the volume from the portion of the tip occupied by the liquid wherever it is.[00882]    (2) Correction of assay calibration by incorporation of liquid volume measurement [00883]    This is achieved as illustrated in the following simulation. Consider an assay in which a sample is combined with two reagents (called 1 and 2). The target volume for sample, reagent 1 and reagent 2 is 10 uL. The assay result is calculated from a standard curve relating measured signal to analyte concentration. As part of the assay calibration process the experiments can be performed in which volumes used for sample and reagents are changed to 8 and 12 uL in addition to 10 uL and assay results calculated based on the calibration appropriate for 10 uL volumes. In Figure 105, Figure 106, and Figure 107, the results were plotted against actual volumes. For the sample volume, the assay result is essentially directly proportional to the volume used (shown in Figure 105). For the reagents, somewhat non-rectilinear responses were seen (shown in Figure 106 and Figure 107). These responses are based on \"typical\" assays well-known in the field and the magnitude of the changes with volume are representative.[00884]    We then simulate an evaluation in which we have imposed a degree of random error (about 5 %, to reflect a \"real world situation\") on assay results in addition to the effects of the use of inappropriate volumes. We include results in which sample, reagent 1 and reagent 2 volumes are set at 8, 10 and 12 uL in all combinations. When the results from this exercise are plotted as shown in Figure 108 without correction for volume errors, as would be expected there is a significant error in the reported result due to ignoring the fact that the actual volumes used were different from those used for assay calibration.[00885]    When we allow for the volume variances from target values using the known assay response to volumes, and plot corrected analyte values we obtain the much improved result shown in Figure 109, however. This was achieved by multiple regression analysis of the data.[00886]    Summary statistics comparing results calculated with and without volume correction are presented in the table below and reflect a significant improvement in all metrics by the use of volume correction. SEE is the standard error of the estimate.   ;A 028251962013-07-18 Regression                        Correlation Volume correction          slope    coefficient Analyte CV SEE/Mean No correction              0.994     0.914      13.3     16.5 Correction                 0.999     0.994      3.6      7.4 Example 20: Hemagglutination inhibition assay read using microscopy and image analysis: [00887]    In phosphate buffered saline (100 uL), containing 0.3 % wiv glutaraldehyde stabilized turkey red blood cells, and 0.5 mg,/mL bovine serum albumin and, where indicated, 2 hemagglutination units of inactivated influenza virus and 15 ug goat polyclonal anti-influenza B antibody were incubated for 15 minutes in a conical bottom PCR tube at RT. The reaction product from the bottom of the tube was transferred to a transparent slide illuminated with white light and imaged with a 4-fold magnification using a digital camera. As may be seen in Figure 131, agglutination caused by reaction of the red cells with the hemeagglutinin of the virus (Figure 131 sample 3) is easily observable by comparison with an unagglutinated control (Figure 131 sample 1). When excess antibody to the virus was also present agglutination was completely inhibited. Two effects of the agglutination reaction are notable, (1) in agglutinated samples, there are more red cells due to the more rapid sedimentation of the agglutinates compared with the control and (2) each red cell is on average more clustered with other red cells. The agglutination reaction can be quantified following image recognition software to identify, locate and count red cells and agglutinates.[00888]    Figure 131 sample 1 shows a non-agglutinated control (no virus, no antibody). Figure 131 sample 2 shows non agglutinated sample (virus plus antibody). Figure 131 sample 3 shows an agglutinated (virus, no antibody).Example 21: Sample preparation, examination of supernatant quality and estimation of the quality of the LDL precipitate [00889]    Plasma was diluted (1:10) into a mixture of dextran sulfate (25mg/dL) and magnesium sulfate (100mM) then incubated for 1 minute to precipitate LDL-cholesterol. The reaction product was aspirated into the tube of a centrifuge, capped then and spun at 3000 rpm for three minutes. Images were taken of the original reaction mixture prior to centrifugation (showing the white precipitate), following centrifugation (showing a clear supernatant) and of the LDL-cholesterol pellet (after removal of the cap). For example, Figures 132, 134 illustrate examples of images taken of reaction product.[00890]    Tillages of the LDL-precipitation reaction product were analyzed as follows. The pixel color levels were plotted as a function of their vertical position. The variance of the values was measured and values for the three colors summed. Because of the particles of precipitated LDL, which strongly scatter light, the precipitate value (1154) was much greater than (672) of the clear supernatant. Comparison of the supernatant value with that of a control no exposed to the precipitation reagent allows the quality of the centrifugation to be evaluated (data not shown). Figure 133 provides examples of images that were analyzed before spinning in the centrifuge, and after spinning in the centrifuge.[00891]    After removal of the black vinyl cap, an image of the LDL precipitate was taken. Its volume can be measured quite accurately, knowing the geometry of the tip and the size of a pixel in the image. In this experiment, the volume of the precipitate was estimated as 0.155 -hi- 0.015 uL.   ;A 028251962013-07-18 Example 22: Improving the performance of an assay for alanine aminotransferase (ALT) by use of 3-color image blanking of optical signals due to the sample [00892]    ALT in serum can be measured in an assay in which the enzyme converts alanine to pyruvate which is in turn used to make hydrogen peroxide with oxygen and pyruvatc oxidasc. The peroxide is then used to make a colored product by the enzyme horseradish peroxidase, aminoantipyrene and N-Ethyl-N- (3-sulfopropyl)aniline. The colored product absorbs maximally at 560 run.[00893]    It was found that some serum samples have significant absorbance at this wavelength as shown in Figure 135 and accordingly interfered with the assay. In particular when using relatively high sample concentrations (such as a final dilution in the assay of 1:10), 3-color image analysis or the ALT assay gave poor results with clinical samples.[00894]    Figure 135 illustrates spectra of several scrum samples diluted 1:10 into buffer; OD is plotted against wavelength (nm). Great variation of OD is illustrated in Figure 135.[00895]    In conventional spectroscopy, this issue is dealt with by taking a blank reading of the sample without the assay ingredients added and subtracting the blank from the signal generated by the assay. In 3-color image analysis as in the present invention, it has been found that an analogous method can be used. The diluted sample may be imaged and three-color values extracted. The assay calibration algorithm may then be changed to include the signals from the unreacted sample. Specifically in this case, the original algorithm (not including sample blank signal) was ALT concentration = a + b*R + c*G + d*B + e*R2 where a, b, c, d and e are empirically derived constants and R, G, B are the signal values in red, green and blue channels respectively. The improved algorithm was: ALT concentration = a + b*R + c*G + d*B + e*Rs, + P'Rs2 where Rs is the signal from the sample blank in the red channel (note that the empirically derived values of a, b, c, d and e were different from those of the original algorithm).[00896]    When 21 serum samples ranging in ALT activity from 0 to 250 U/L were measured in triplicate and results of 3-color image analysis compared with those provided by a clinical laboratory method (Teco) the following regression statistics were obtained indicating much-improved results.Calibration method    RA2      Slope       Intercept (U/L)    SEEOriginal            0.922      0.922       4.5          18.9 Improved            0.972      0.972       1.6          10.0 Example 23: Speeding-up and providing objective analysis of a hemagglutination inhibition assay for anti-influenza antibodies [00897]    Reaction mixtures prepared as described in Example 20, were incubated for only one minute then introduced into three separate micro channels (as described for the cytometry examples above) and imaged. About 5-10 images are taken for each sample, in order to get adequate statistics. On average, each image consists of around 800-900 cells. The agglutination process can be objectively evaluated by measuring the radial distribution of cells around a representative selection of individual cells using the function.[00898]    The images were processed to obtain centroid positions of the individual cells in 2D space. The 2D positions were used to compute a radial distribution function (RDF), also known as a pair correlation function.   ;A 028251962013.07-18 The radial distribution function, g(r) quantifies thc probability of finding a cell at a distance r from the selected cell. Mathematically, g(r) = p(r)/ Po where p(r)27crdr is the number of cells found at a distance of r from a particular cell and Po is the average cell density over the entire image window. The value g(r) is calculated as an average over all particles in the image and over multiple images, to ensure a statistically meaningful result.[00899]    Results [00900]    The value of the first peak of g(r) quantifies the number of doublets in the sample. hence, the g(r) for the agglutinated sample should be higher in magnitude compared to the other two samples. The value ofg rises quickly from 0 to a maximum over a distance of about 20 pixels (corresponding to about 12 um about twice the diameter of a red cell) then declines to about 1Ø As shown below, the agglutination due to virus was distinguishable from no agglutination when virus is absent or antibody inhibits the virus-induced agglutination.Virus                Antibody      Agglutination    gmax None                 None          No            1.44 Present              None          Yes           1.67 Present              Present       No            1.47 Example 24: Preparation of analyte detection systems using aptamers [00901]    Two oligo DNA aptamers were designed to selectively capture proteins (thrombin and insulin). The oligo DNA aptamer was composed of a binding site having a sequence selected from published data, an inert portion to extend the binding site from the surface of the bead or microarray, and a reactive group to chemically immobilize the aptamer to the surface. Aptamer 1 (specific for thrombin) had the following sequence: 5' ___________________ Am-(T)45GGTTGGTGTGGTTGG    3'. Aptamer 2 (specific for insulin) had the following sequence: 5' __________________________________ Am-(T)32ACAGGGGTGTGGGGACAGGGGTGTGGGG    3'. The \"Am\" at the beginning of each sequence represents an amino group.[00902]    The two aptamers were immobilized on polystyrene beads (Sum) functionalized with carboxyl groups. The beads were then washed and the excess reagent removed. The beads were then mixed with oligo DNA probes fluorescently labeled and complementary to the binding sites of the aptamers. Hybridization of the probes with the aptamers was detected by fluorescence emission. Only the complementary probe showed a positive hybridization event, as measured by mean fluorescence emission. Hybridization specificity is illustrated by comparison of Figure 139, which shows beads after hybridization with complementary probe, to Figure 140, which shows beads after hybridization with non-complementary probe. Detection was performed with a laser excitation at 635nm, and emission filtered at 650nm ( 10nm) on a CCD camera, after deposition of the beads on the analysis substrate. A similar procedure was used on a glass surface coated with epoxysilane to immobilize Aptamers 1 and 2. The array was hybridzed with the fluorescent probe and the specific recognition of the aptamer binding site measured by fluorescence emission detection with a CCD camera set-up and an Array Scanner (lnopsys). Figure 141 illustrates the binding specificity of the aptamers on the array, with more detail illustrated in Figure 142. Figure 143 shows an example array scan.   ;A 028251962013-07-18 Example 25: Detection of analyte using aptamers [00903]    An array comprising Aptamer 1 hybridized with fluorescently labeled, complementary probe was prepared as in Example 24. Thrombin was introduced to the array at a concentration of about 100n1\\4 and allowed to react with the Aptamer 1-probe complex. The fluorescent emission signal from Aptamer 1 on the array was reduced by 2.5 fold, indicating displacement of the probe by binding of Aptamer 1 and thrombin. Example 26: binders [00904]    Two types of binder are biotinylated and used to create capture surfaces on an assay unit solid-phase coated with avidin. Assay reagent production and luminescence-readout assay results are obtained using (1) aptamers and (2) single-chain Fv antibody fragments (SCFVs) on microliter plates. Aptamer and SCFVs as binders for luminescence-based assays are adaptable to tips and imaging systems and devices provided herein. Analytes can be assayed and read using cameras to measure color by changing the signal-generating reagent from alkaline phosphatase to, e.g., horse-radish peroxidasc with a chromogcnic substrate or using alkaline phosphatase with a chromogenic substrate. Tips in microtiter plate (or other formats) can be read in any cartridge (assay unit) format.Example 27: Vitamin D Assay Using DNA Aptamers on Microtiter Plate [00905]    In this example, an assay for vitamin D is performed using single-stranded DNA aptamers. Biotinylated DNA aptamers are coated on a ultravidin coated polystyrene surface of a microliter plate having a plurality of wells. Before coating, the aptamers are quickly denatured and renatured by heating at about 95 degrees Celsius, then immediately cooled on ice. About 15 microliters of the refolded biotinylated vitamin D DNA aptamers in 25 mM Tris, containing NaCl, MgCl2, 10% Ethanol, pH 7.5, are then added into each well to form the capture surface. After coating, the wells are washed and blocked with about 100 uL of a blocking reagent to reduce nonspecific binding.[00906]    The analyte for the assay (vitamin D) is diluted in Tris, NaCI, MgCl2, 10% Ethanol, pH 7.5, and is mixed with a solution of vitamin D-Alkaline Phosphatase conjugate at different concentrations in the desired assay range, and provided to the assay unit for 10 minutes incubation at room temperature. The assay unit is then washed three times with 100 uL of wash buffer. About 40 uL of substrate for Alkaline phosphatase is added to each assay well and chemiluminescence data (table below) is collected after about 10 minutes.

In this assay, the inner surface of the assay unit is coated with biotinylated scFy on ultravidin coated polystyrene surface of a microtitcr plate having a plurality of wells. About 15 microliters of 1 ug/ml biotinylated scFv in Tris buffered Saline, pH 8, 0.03% BSA, 0.05% Thimerasol were added to each assay unit. After washing, each assay unit is fixed with 100 uL Fixative reagent followed by an overnight dry with dry air and stored dessicated.[00908]    The analyte for the assay (free estradiol) is diluted in Tris buffered Saline, pll 8, BSA, Thimerasol, mixed with an estradiol-Alkaline Phosphatase conjugate, in stabilizer from Biostab, and is provided to the assay unit coated with the scfv for about 10 minutes at room temperature.[00909]    The assay wells are then washed 5 times with 100 uL of wash buffer. After the washes, 40 uL of luminogenic substrate for Alkaline phosphatase (KPL PhosphaGlo) is added to each assay unit and chemiluminescence data (table below) is collected after about 10 minutes.

However, in some cases the range of the imaging system is more limited, such as from about 4000 cells/ul to 7000 cells/ul. If the cell concentration is less than 4000 cells/ul, the system may not be able to enumerate a target of 10,000 cells, as may be required by the assay. If the cell concentration in the sample is more than 7000 cells/ill, each field of view may be too crowded to perform accurate image segmentation and cell enumeration. An exemplary approach for imaging WBCs is provided below.[00911]    In an example, an imaging system (e.g., cytometer) is provided configured for fluorescence spectrophotometry. The system uses fluorescence spectrophotometry to measure the cell concentration in the sample. The sample is labeled with fluorescently conjugated antibodies for imaging (e.g., AF647-CD45) and also with a fluorescent nucleic acid marker (e.g., DRAQ5). A quantitative fluorescence readout on the spectrophotometer module provides a measurement of the concentration of WBCs at low sensitivity (LLOQ of about 5000 cellsiul) but high dynamic range (e.g., 5000-100,000 cells/ul). A concentration measured on the spectrophotometer allows the calculation of the optimal dilution ratio such that the final concentration of the cell suspension is between 4000-7000 cellsml.   ;A 028251962013-07-18 [00912]    Figure 146 shows the high dynamic range of fluorescence in the spectrophotometric measurement of WBC concentration. WBCs tagged with fluorescently labeled anti-CD45 and other antibodies were excited with red light having a wavelength of about 640 nm and the quantitative fluorescence emission spectrum was collected. Integrated fluorescence is plotted on the y-axis.Example 30: Streptococcus Group A Detection by Isothermal Amplification [00913]    Isothermal amplification of specific genomic samples can be detected by turbidity. In this example, a genomic sample extracted from Streptococcus group A (StrepA) cells (stock concentration = 2x108 org/ml from My biosource) was amplified by isothermal amplification and the progress of the reaction measured by Turbidity. About 5 ul of stock bacterial cells and 45 ul RT PCR grade Water (10X dilution of stock) were heat treated at about 95 degrees Celsius from about 8 to 10 minutes (Cell ruptures and releases the DNA). The genomic sample was diluted and introduced in a sample volume of about 25 ul in a PCR tube containing reagents for amplification (e.g., DNA Polymcrasc, Primers, Buffer). The PCR tube was incubated at about 61 degrees Celsius for about 60 minutes while the progress of the reaction was recorded by turbidity. The results are as follows, and Figure 147 shows plots of turbidity as a function of time:Conc.

Experiment A was performed using StrepA having a synthetic genomic DNA template (from Genescript). Experiment B was performed by diluting stock StrepA 10-fold followed by heat inactivation at 95 degrees Celsius from about 8 to min, and followed by serial dilution of heat inactivated ten-fold diluted stock StrepA.

"Description\n\n一种溶磷复合微生物菌剂及其应用\n\n技术领域\n\t\n本发明属于微生物菌剂领域，具体地说，涉及一种溶磷复合微生物菌剂及其应用。\n\n\n背景技术\n\t\n(一)溶磷微生物菌剂发展现状\n我国90％以上的耕地缺磷，使用磷肥是解决作物增产的主要措施，磷肥日益成为限制我国农业可持续发展的瓶颈。我国是世界化肥消费第一大国，也是磷肥第一消费大国，每年磷肥消费量1100万吨左右。众所周知，我国磷矿资源缺乏，保有储量151.98亿吨，再过20年中高品位磷矿开采殆尽(李志宁，2003a，李志宁，2003b)，不得不依靠购买国外高价磷矿石保障粮食生产。一些研究显示，我国磷肥当季利用率仅为3.22～18％(周晓芬，马民强，1994；张李康，1997；崔正忠等，2001；周广业等，1991；李云等，2002)。磷肥施入土壤后80～90％很快被土壤固定(范丙全等，1998，2004a)，石灰性土壤中有效磷转变成溶解度极低的磷灰石(lschmidt & Nixon，1944；Murrmann & Peech，1968)，而在酸性土壤中形成磷酸铁和磷酸铝(Ford，1933)。我国自20世纪70年代使用磷肥以来，土壤磷积累显著(林葆，2009)。土壤磷绝大部分以难溶无机磷形态存在，释放缓慢，作物有效性低。随着辚肥用量增加，磷肥转化为极难利用的闭蓄态磷(来路等，2003)与高稳定性有机磷(黄庆海等，2003)。解决土壤磷的活化与释放是提高土壤磷和磷肥利用效率的关键。因此，增强土壤磷有效性，提高磷肥增产效益，是我国农业可持续发展的必然之路。\n溶磷微生物是一类具有活化土壤难溶无机磷能力的有益微生物。应用溶磷微生物活化土壤难溶磷是世界公认的安全、经济和有效的生物措施(Kucey，1988；Kamble & Mohite，1996；Morales等.，2007；El-Gawad等.，2009)，倍受各国科学家和政府高度重视。开展高效溶磷微生物研究与利用，对于挖掘土壤磷资源的利用潜力、节约磷肥、发挥我国有限磷矿资源的增产作用和农业持续发展意义重大。\n溶磷真菌(Salih等.，1989；王延秋等，1993；Vassileva，1998；Asea等.，988；Abd-Alla & Omar，2001；程淑琴等，2003；Wakelin等.，2007；Morales等.，2007)和溶磷细菌(Rasal，等.，2004；Raychaudhuri，等.，2003；Orhan，等.，2006；)都具有显著增加土壤有效磷、提高作物产量能力，以及节约磷肥的效果(El-Lateef，1998；Suri，等.，2006)。同时，溶磷微生物提高磷肥利用率(Tomar等，1994；Tomar等，1996；Kamble &Mohite，1996；范丙全等，2004a)、改善作物品质的能力(Hamed，2003；El-Gawad，2009)，溶磷微生物对于提高土壤难溶磷和磷肥的生物有效性具有巨大应用潜力。\n以往研究涉及面非常广，为溶磷微生物应用提供了技术支撑。然而，长期以来没有重视溶磷微生物在大范围、大区域与多种土壤、多种作物的广泛适应性进行研究，使得大量溶磷菌种很大程度上无法找到更适合的应用土壤与作物，难以发挥溶解土壤磷和增强磷肥有效性的最大潜力。严重限制了溶磷菌的使用范围和应用潜力发挥。对整体溶磷微生物资源而言，可能造成了巨大浪费，由此导致各国溶磷微生物菌剂研究和生产进入更大误区。一些国家仍然以单株溶磷菌株生产溶磷微生物菌剂，而在全国范围所有土壤和各种上使用。世界上大型溶磷微生物菌剂公司，如加拿大Philom Bios公司使用单株溶磷拜莱青霉菌(Penicillium bilaii)(Kucey，1988，1989)生产微生物菌剂JumpStart。印度Ruchi Biochemicals公司使用生产一种溶磷微生物，推荐在全国使用。比利时以一株溶磷细菌生产菌剂Phosphorene(Ahmed等.，999)。我国主要以巨大芽孢杆菌(Bacillus megatarium)生产溶磷微生物菌剂(葛诚，吴薇，1995；姜瑞波，2005；范丙全，2007)。其他国家情形大致相似。没有考虑溶磷微生物与地域、土壤类型、作物种类的最佳适配性，溶磷微生物菌剂的使用效果受到严重影响。\n因此，针对我国土壤磷有效性低、难溶磷积累，磷肥利用率持续下降的现状，并且针对我国缺乏高效广谱溶磷微生物菌种资源、微生物菌剂产业仍然使用适应范围窄、溶磷能力低的老菌种的现状，筛选和培育广泛适用我国各类主要土壤、多种作物的新的溶磷微生物菌株，是开发高效溶磷微生物菌剂的重要前提。\n(二)土传病害防治菌剂发展现状\n我国土传病害、连作障碍日趋严重，造成大面积减产，土传病害防治是保障粮食安全的必然途径。土传病害、连作障碍发生严重已经成为我国粮食持续增产的威胁因素。尽管我国对土传病害进行了长期研究，但是土传病害、连作障碍防治技术没有得到有效的解决，尤其是防治土传病害、连作障碍的微生物防治技术依然缺乏。发展多功能微生物菌剂，是解决土传病害、连作障碍防治，确保粮食安全的重大需求。\n由于人口急剧增长和耕地数量的限制，以及人类对高产出、高收入的追求，连作栽培成为我国农业生产的常见措施。连作种植出现作物生长发育不良、土传病害频繁加重、产量和品质下降等问题，给我国农业生产造成巨大的经济损失，是农业可持续发展急需解决的重大课题。\n农业生产正在朝着无公害、有机农业方向发展，微生物制剂及其应用技术对于发展绿色农业、建立有机食品安全工程体系具有重要作用。我国蔬菜、果树、花卉已经发展到4亿亩，其中，蔬菜播种面积2.82亿亩，总产量6.37万吨。保护地蔬菜超过5000多万亩，总产量1.68亿吨，而且有机蔬菜出口基地面积急剧增加；西瓜种植约500-1000万亩，西瓜连作障碍是世界上长期存在的难题，产量和品质下降。研究显示，黄瓜、番茄、西葫芦、甜椒等作物连作3年以上，每年产量降低10％-20％，连作4-5年的作物减产40％甚至一半以上。土传病害、连作障碍对粮食作物发展造成了严重危害，我国大豆种植面积大约有1.45亿亩，由于连年种植、病害频繁并且发生面积大，引发作物减产甚至绝收。连作障碍已经成为农业生产发展的瓶颈，研究开发高效防治土传病害、消除连作障碍微生物菌剂迫在眉睫。利用微生物菌剂提高作物产量、改善作物品质、防治作物病害、节约化肥，提高土壤的持续增产潜力有重要地位。\n做为防治土传病害的微生物菌剂产品各国非常重视，已经商品化产品如澳大利亚的K84，放射形龙杆菌菌株K84(Agrobacteriumradiobacterstrain k84)在1973年就被大规模生产，用来防治由根癌病土壤(Agrobacterium tumefaciens)引起的感染(Kerr，A，1980)；1988年Gustafson公司在美国注册生产A13的PGPR产品Kodiak，成为作物促生菌商业化生产的拓疆者，商业化最成功的产品是Agrobacteriumradiobacter K84。美国研制的Topshield(哈茨木霉T22)和以色列研制的Trichodex(哈茨木霉T39)均是用于防治真菌病害如灰霉病以及以色列Mycontrol公司开发的商品制剂Trichoderma2000主要用于防治立枯丝核菌、齐整小核菌、疫霉等；盾壳霉也是研究较多的一种生防菌，盾壳霉对核盘菌属及葱白腐小菌核菌引起的多种植物病害均有很强的抑制作用。现在国外已有商品化产品出现，如前苏联开发的商品制剂Coniothyrin可以用于防治向日葵的菌核病，德国开发的商品制剂ContansWG可以用于防治莴苣的核盘菌菌核病等等。此外还有针对粘帚霉的由美国研制成功的SoilGard，用于防治猝倒病和根腐等，意大利研制的BiofoxC专用于防治镰刀菌属病害等。我国商品化的木霉菌杀菌剂(生菌消，又名灭菌灵)，主要用于防治各种作物的霜霉病(沈寅初，2000)，我国开发的5406抗生菌为链霉菌属，定名为泾阳链霉菌，对黄萎病菌、枯萎病菌、立枯病菌、猝倒病菌等多种植物病害具有抗性，并且可促进植物生长(包建中，1998)。江苏省农科院植保所防治水稻病害的拮抗细菌(Bacillus subtilis)，大面积示范推广试验证明，拮抗菌在水稻植株上定植能力较强，繁殖较快，对纹枯病防效达75％～85％，对稻曲病防效达63.8％～85.7％(陈志谊，2001)。沈阳农业大学生物农药工程中心利用拮抗木霉和拮抗细菌混合发酵制成粉剂，成功地防治了保护地蔬菜和甜瓜的苗期病害，其它报道的细菌杀菌剂还有用来防治黄瓜及烟草炭疽病菌的地衣芽孢杆菌，防治甘蔗黑腐病的枯草芽孢杆菌，荧光假单孢杆菌(Pseudomonas radiobacter)防治小麦全蚀病等。\n微生物菌剂防治土传病害、连作障碍是当前主要发展方向。大棚蔬菜土壤、大豆连作农田、棉花产区农田、西瓜生产基地农田等是我国土传病害、连作障碍最为严重的地区，研制、开发和生产防治主要作物土传病害以及连作障碍，对于我国粮食增产、减少农药使用量、保障农产品品安全作用巨大。\n广适应型的溶磷生物菌种资源不仅我国缺乏，而且世界范围也未见报道，广适应性(土壤、作物)的溶磷微生物菌剂研发未见报道。在溶磷促生的基础上，配合高效防治土传病害的菌株，在解决提供磷素营养的同时，解决防治土传病害和提高作物产量的技术瓶颈。本研究主要针对危害最为严重的真菌病害，选用了世界上防治土传病害效果最好的菌种。将广泛适应性溶磷微生物菌种与高效拮抗土传病害的微生物菌种联合使用，能够更加有效地达到溶解土壤难溶磷、提高磷肥利用率的同时，防治土传病害和提高作物产量的多个目标。因此，为我国缺磷和磷肥利用率低、土传病害严重、增产潜力下降地区的农田提供高效多功能微生物菌剂，对我国粮食持续增产、节约磷肥资源、减少作物病害和保护农田生态环境具有重要意义。\n\n\n发明内容\n\t\n本发明的目的是针对我国缺磷和磷肥利用率低、土传病害严重、增产潜力下降的农田的现状，提供一种新的溶磷复合微生物菌剂及其应用。\n为了实现本发明目的，本发明提供一种首次分离自我国湖南省浏阳磷矿区土壤中的溶磷菌，菠萝泛菌(Pantoea ananatis)P41-3A，已保藏于中国微生物菌种保藏管理委员会普通微生物中心，地址：北京市朝阳区北辰西路1号院3号中国科学院微生物研究所，保藏日期2011年12月12日，保藏号CGMCC NO.5568。\n菠萝泛菌(Pantoea ananatis)P41-3A菌落形态为：菌落不规则，光滑，黄色；G-，杆菌，有鞭毛，运动性。\n菠萝泛菌(Pantoea ananatis)P41-3A的微生物学特性为：苯丙氨酸脱氨酶反应为阴性，赖氨酸脱羧酶实验为阳性，利用丙二酸，利用卫矛醇产酸。V-P试验阴性，甲基红MR反应阳性，明胶液化反应阳性，吲哚阴性，脲酶阴性，H2S产生阴性，丙二酸利用反应阳性，柠檬酸利用阴性，硝酸盐还原反应阳性，苯丙氨酸脱氨阴性，赖氨酸脱羧酶反应阳性，精氨酸双水解酶阴性，葡萄糖产酸反应阳性，葡萄糖产气阴性，甘露醇反应阳性，卫矛醇反应阳性，肌醇反应阳性，半乳糖反应阳性，鼠李糖反应阳性，山梨醇反应阳性，阿拉伯糖反应阳性，果糖反应阳性，木糖反应阳性，海藻糖+d。\n本发明还提供含有所述菠萝泛菌(Pantoea ananatis)P41-3A的微生物菌剂。\n本发明还提供菠萝泛菌(Pantoea ananatis)P41-3A及其微生物菌剂在防治作物病害中的应用，所述作物病害包括根腐病、枯萎病，疫病、立枯病、猝倒病、纹枯病、白绢病和/或白粉病等。\n本发明还提供一种溶磷复合微生物菌剂，其有效成分为菠萝泛菌(Pantoea ananatis)、寡雄腐霉(Pythium oligandrum)、哈兹木霉(Trichoderma harzianum)以及淡紫拟青霉(Paecilomyces lilacinus)。\n优选地，其有效成分为菠萝泛菌(Pantoea ananatis)

"Description\n\n色杆菌的配方、成分、代谢物和使用方法\n\n技术领域\n本发明所述为色杆菌(Chromobacterium)滤液、上清液和提取物的用途、成份或配方，原本作为杀螨剂和杀虫剂使用，具有杀虫活性的化合物或其代谢物，特别是用于防治下列一种或一种以上的害虫，如蜱螨目、金龟子科、果蝇科、叉木虱科、蜜蜂科、蝇科、花蝇科和拟步甲科等。本发明所述再包括有生物性杀虫剂(也简称为生物杀虫剂)的配方，尤其是含色杆菌滤液、上清液、提取物、代谢物或其衍生物中，具有杀虫活性的化合物和其制造方法和防治害生物入侵的方法。更具体来说，本发明提供具有高稳定性的生物杀虫剂特性，因为其均匀的物理特性具有更长的保存期限，因为对日光曝晒的高抗降解特性，具有更耐久的使用后杀虫活性。\n\n\n背景技术\n使用微生物、植物和其它生物体所制成的天然产品，此微生物天然产物具有丰富多样性的化学成份来源，并此天然产品在医药用途已有长久的历史。虽然天然产品主要用于人体治疗，其中超过50％的产品来自天然产品，只有11％的杀虫剂是使用天然原料。然而，天然原料制成的杀虫剂，在传统和有机农场的虫害控制上举足轻重。微生物(细菌、放线菌和真菌)的次级代谢物提供新的化学成份，可将已知的成份进行单方或复方使用，以有效控制虫害并降低耐药性增强的可能风险。关于微生物天然产品在农业杀虫剂上的成功应用，有几个著名的例子(汤普森(Thompson)等人，2000；阿瑞娜(Arena)等人，1995；克力克(Krieg)等人，1983)。\n微生物杀虫剂的开发始于尾随纯培养物的析离，然后通过体外、体内、温室或农地的实验，进行其疗效和应用范围的筛选，同时进行微生物制造成份的析离和鉴定，关于微生物杀虫剂的商品化，可通过工业发酵的方法大量而经济地制造微生物，进行生物相容性的配方处理，添加经核可的添加物来增加药效，将应用便利性和农地条件下的储存稳定性最大化。\n色杆菌\n在2000年，马丁(Martin)博士和其同事在USDA从马里兰州的农地上壤中，析离出某种紫色的细菌(马丁等人，2007a)，在最初的筛选中，他们发现这种细菌对科罗拉多州的马铃薯甲虫等害虫具有毒性(马丁等人，2007b)，此种运动型细菌属革兰氏染色阴性，被界定为新种的色杆菌，即色杆菌苏比丝加(Chromobacterium substsugae sp.nov)(马丁等人，2007c)，它兼有嗜氧和运动性，属革兰阴性的β-变形菌(beta-proteobacterium)而具有极生鞭毛，使用L-琼脂与25℃下持续培养2-3天的菌落最初呈现奶油色，在接下来的24小时逐渐被称为暗紫色。PRAA4-1的菌落在蛋白胨培养基中，于25℃、pH值6.5～8.0和0-1.5％(w/v)氯化钠的条件下生长情况良好(马丁等人，2007a)。\n因为马丁和其同事所发现的色杆菌苏比丝加中，至少析离出3个色杆菌新种，杨(Young)等人(2008)也从台湾的泉水样本析离出新的色杆菌种水生色杆菌(C.aquaticum)，肯普法(Kampfer)等人(2009)也从马来西亚的环境中析离出两个新菌种，即色杆菌皮丝西纳(C.piscinae)和假紫色色杆菌(C.pseudoviolaceum)。\n在所有来自土壤和水源的已知色杆菌种中，紫色色杆菌(C.violaceum)属革兰氏阴性。关于色杆菌生成次级代谢物已发布的研究论文中，仅限于紫色色杆菌的菌种(参见实例如度伦(Duran)和门克(Menck)(2001)关于紫色色杆菌菌种在药理和工业应用上的全面性探讨)。此菌种通常被认为对人类不具有致病性，但属可能致病的病原体，在人体和动物体中，偶尔变成为败血症的病原体，而导致败血症和致命的感染。紫色色杆菌已知可生成某种紫色成份即紫色杆菌素，出现氧气的情况下，可融合两个L-色氨酸分子而形成1个双吲哚分子(星野(Hoshino)等人，1987；瑞安(Ryan)和德雷南(Drennan)；2009)。紫色杆菌素生物合成可通过群体感应来调节，为革兰氏阳性菌中1个调节各种次生代谢物途径的共同机制(麦克林(McClean)等人，1997)。\n度伦和门克(2001)所摘要列举的紫色色杆菌代谢物包括氰化氢、铁草氨菌素E(FERRIOXAMINE E)、B-内酰胺糖肽SQ28504和SQ28546、抗生素如气花青素、阿罗卡因(aerocavin)、3,6-二羟基-苯并异恶唑、单酰胺菌素(monobactam)SB-26.180和抗肿瘤的缩酚酸肽FR901228。根据度伦和门克(2001)的研究，紫色色杆菌也制造不寻常的糖化合物如胞外多醣和脂多醣的成份。\n美国专利申请案US20120100236也揭露可得白色杆菌种的化合物成份，更具体来说为色杆菌苏比丝加的色杆菌种。\n螨虫和杀螨剂\n二斑叶螨属叶螨科，红蜘蛛也许是观赏植物中最重要的害虫，在温室和农地作物中，有180余个品种造成相当大的损害，这些螨虫也就是最难以防治的节肢动物害虫，可快速养成抗药性(斯塔普斯(Stamps)和奥士邦(Osborne)2009；奥士邦、爱乐(Ehler)和尼科尔斯(Necho1s)，1999)。\n杀螨剂属具有杀灭螨虫(杀螨剂)和蜱虫(杀蜱剂)的毒性，此类的杀虫剂种类繁多，包括有抗生素、氨基甲酸酯类、甲脒杀螨剂、拟除虫菊酯类、螨虫生长调节剂和有机磷杀螨剂。除了化学杀虫剂外，硅藻土和脂肪酸也可用于防治螨虫，通常可破坏螨虫的角质层让其干死。此外，某些精油如薄荷油也可用于防治螨虫，尽管已有种类繁多的杀螨剂化合物，因为对作物造成的损害，在农业上，螨虫危害仍属严重的问题。在一个季节中螨虫可繁衍数代，快速养成对杀螨剂产品的抗药性，因此，急需具有新用途和新方法的杀虫剂产品。\n家蝇\n舍蝇(家蝇)是蝇科成员，此科被视为国内和国外在全球各地经济上的问题，其它蝇科的成员包括面蝇，厩螫蝇和角蝇，被认为害虫是人类和动物的病媒虫。此虫习惯以垃圾、粪便和人类的食物为食，成为致病微生物的最佳传染病媒虫，此病媒虫通过开放性的伤口成为动物传染性疾病的害虫。\n以植物为食的果蝇—斑翼果蝇\n斑翼果蝇是美国地区果蔬种植区的新入侵者，其破坏性较众所周知的黑腹果蝇和其它的果蝇危害更甚，因为樱桃果蝇(D.suzukii)以破坏完整的果蔬为食，而其它的果蝇只以腐烂的植物为食。\n根蛆\n根蛆属花蝇科，以不同植物的根为食，大白菜的根蛆危害卷心菜、菜花、西兰花和抱子甘蓝等(此类的蔬菜也称为“油菜作物”)，不同种类的根蛆也危害胡萝卜、洋葱、蔬菜和其它作物，因为油菜作物属冷季型蔬菜，白菜根蛆在美国北方危害更甚，而难以防治，因为其孵化和喂食行为都发生在土壤下，所以当你发现到叶子发育不良或枯萎时，才知道他们的存在。\n桃蚜\n烟蚜(桃蚜)属常蚜科(见US20110054022)，由其俗名得知，桃蚜是各种果蔬和观赏植物的害虫并遍布全球，这些害虫危害更甚，因为不只通过取食韧皮部而造成直接的损害，也是李痘病毒的潜在宿主，这是李树痘病的病媒而导致果实变形和变色。因此，感染株需连根拔起，目前正通过各种杀虫剂来防治这些害虫，但这些害虫常养成抗药性。\n马铃薯木虱\n马铃薯/番茄木虱(马铃薯木虱)属叉木虱科，是斑马纹病的病原体，通过革兰氏阴性菌来感染。虽然原产于北美洲，已在纽西兰发现到此物种(WWW.biosecurity.govt.nz/files/pests/potato-tomato-psyllid/psyillid-factsheet.pdf)，马铃薯木虱通常生长于茄科宿主(如番茄和马铃薯)中，但也可在其它植物如辣椒、茄子、红薯、波罗蜜、树番茄和曼陀罗中发现到。\n枯叶甲虫\n大黄粉虫是危害家禽业极为严重的害虫属拟步甲科，据报Bt菌株PS8681对拟步行虫具有防治活性(海客里(Hickle)的美国专利5,100,665等)，拟步行虫亚种(Bttenebrionis)对此甲虫的幼虫可能也有防治活性(美国专利5,244,660)，枯叶甲虫和其它某些鞘翅目为原生动物、细菌和病毒性传染病的宿主，对鸡和火鸡饲养业造成重大的经济损失。枯叶甲虫属致病性沙门氏菌的重要病猫，包括许多的病媒种如肠道沙门菌(S.enterica)血清型肠炎。此问题就是感染有病原微生物如沙门氏菌的家禽，危害人体健康，这些甲虫栖息于垃圾、木材、发泡塑料、玻璃纤维和鸡舍的聚苯乙烯保温板中，其幼虫和成虫也会在鸟粪和鸡饲料的谷物中滋生，这些大甲虫的群组和其不同的栖息地均在鸡舍内，而难以根除其身上携带的沙门氏菌。在落叶甲虫为患甚剧时，或在新鸡群建立前，不频繁翻动垃圾也不沾染化学杀虫剂，即可提供完全有效的虫害防治。\n蛴螬和甲虫\n蛴螬如白色蛴螬(圆头犀金龟属)、南方隐金龟子(欧洲切根鳃金龟)、日本甲虫的幼虫(日本丽金龟(Popillia japonica))、黑色蛀象鼻虫的幼虫(黑蛀象鼻虫(Otiorhynchussulcatus))、东方甲虫的幼虫(东方异丽金龟)、金龟科成员，已发现到会侵扰草地和牧场。也已发现圣甲虫的成虫会侵扰世界各地的观赏植物和众多的作物，目前已尝试使用过各种的杀虫剂，包括化学杀虫剂、杀线虫剂(如参加美国专利7641573)、苏云金芽孢杆菌(参见美国专利5185158)、费洛蒙和天然驱虫剂如薄荷和韭菜等。\n聚羟基脂肪酸酯(PHA)\n生物塑料即定义为从再生资源所合成的塑料，如植物淀粉和微生物等。生物塑料由一种叫做聚羟基脂肪酸酯(PHA)的成份所制成，PHA家族包括几种聚合酯，如聚羟基丁酸盐、聚羟基丁酸酯、聚羟基丁酸盐、共羟基戊酸乙酯(PHBV)、聚羟基丁酸酯共羟基己酸酯(PHBHx)和聚羟基丁酸酯-共-羟基辛酸酯(PHBO)等，聚3-羟基丁酸(PHB)是最常见的天然微生物PHA成份，聚羟基脂肪酸酯是100％可生物降解的聚合物，含各种羟基烷酸酯(HAS)，由无数微生物所合成，作为基质失恒条件下的能量储备物质，各种合成的热塑性塑料具有类似的特性，如聚丙烯等，也可在有氧条件下，全部降解为水和二氧化碳，并在厌氧条件下，通过土壤、湖水、污水和海水中的微生物降解为甲烷。目前开发中的可生物降解塑料，包括有聚羟基链烷酸酯(PHA)、聚乳酸、脂肪族聚酯、多醣和这些物质的共聚物和/或共混物。\n根据链中的碳原子数，PHA可分为两类：短链(SCL)含3-5个碳原子以及中链(MCL)含6-14个碳原子(康纳S(Khanna S)，丝丽他瓦(Srivastava)，AK.2005)，这些差异主要是因为PHA合成酶的基质特性，一定范围内可容纳3HAS的碳链长度。其它众所周知的PHASCL属共聚物和聚(3-羟基丁酸酯-共-3-羟基戊酸酯)聚(3HB-共-3HV)的物质，含4和5个活性碳原子的单体单元。这些单体单元的比例各有变化，而影响到聚合物的物理特性，如增加3HV的单位可降低脆度。\n在某些微生物的物种中，在碳存量过多而氮来源有限的情况下，即会导致PHA的累积。PHA的成份用于因应压力下的环境，作为储存能量的分子以备不时之需(苏莱曼(Solaiman)和阿什比(Ashby)，2005)。塑料聚合物塑料在这些生物体的细胞内聚积成为光折射的非晶体储存物(姆克赫帕德杨(Mukhopadhyay)等人，2005)，PHB通过3个酶促步骤从乙酰-CoA进行合成步(克浪斯(Krans)等人，1997)，从生物技术的角度来看，可生物降解的生物塑料特征可让其成为污染环境石化塑料的替代品(李(Lee)，1996)，大量增加生物塑料的生产可大幅降低二氧化碳的排放量，削减塑料废物的产生，并减低化石燃料的消耗量。\nPHA可通过下列3种方法取得：微生物的生物合成、转基因植物的光合作用和使用适当的酶进行体外的生物合成(如参见美国专利7455999、W09914313)。在大多数的细菌中，细胞可在伸展有限的基质，如氮、磷或氧中来合成PHA。\n累积的PHA在生物饥饿时，可作为碳源和能源使用，PHA也作为降低功耗的装置，因此而被视为细胞内的氧化还原调节器。PHA也可作为立体调节的化合物，可作为光活性合成化合物的前驱物，此类的化合物特别作为可长期使用的药剂、激素、杀虫剂和除草剂(雷迪(Reddy)2003)的可生物降解载剂成份，也可在骨板、手术缝合线和更换血管中，因为具有压电特性而作为刺激骨骼生长的骨质合成物(舍费尔(Schaefer)等人，2000)，此外，已有许多公开的共聚物生成方法指出，可使用不同的菌种如碱杆菌NCIMB40124(EP.0431883A2)和美国专利7455999成份物，进行生物成份的制造。EP第2236089A1号中揭露这些聚合物用于植入物的整形和软组织固定的装置，WO9I/00917A1揭露的方法，可在特别是植物的原核和真核细胞中，通过聚羟基丁酸酯(PHB)和聚羟基链烷酸酯(PHA)的遗传学和酶学原理，来控制和修改新的聚酯生物聚合物。WO2005/030482A1揭露的方法和用途，可用于堆肥的包装材料上，W02008/110541揭露的聚羟丁酸具有抗热降解的稳定特性。\n木质素\n木质素是高等植物木质结构的主要成份，加工取得的木质素为木材制浆的副产物，例如，木质素的产品包括有木质素磺酸盐、碱质素和氧木质素，这些成份可从亚硫酸盐、硫酸盐和碱废液中取得(斯努克(Snook)，1982，制浆造纸技术手册(Handbook for Pulp＆Paper Technologists)，TAPPI，亚特兰大(Atlanta))。\n目前已发现到木质素有多种商业用途，如碱可溶性的木质素可作为分散剂来使用。美国专利3726850中揭露碱溶性臭氧处理过的木质素产品，其相关的用途，此物质基本上不含有机结合键结的硫，作为粘土、染料、杀虫剂、石墨和其它材料的分散剂来使用。美国专利4666522中揭露木质素磺酸产品可用于制备蜡、油、脂肪、沥青和其混合物的乳液产品。据报导木质素乙酸的相关应用，如作为水基油墨组合物的粘合剂(如参见美国专利4612051)，美国专利5668183中揭露木质素磺酸盐产品可分散脂溶性物质，此外，已揭露有含木质素的杀虫剂复合物(如参见美国专利3813236、美国专利3929453重新发布为美国专利29,238、美国专利4381194、美国专利20110015237、美国专利申请案2010136132、美国专利申请案20100278890、美国专利申请案20080113920、美国专利申请案2006247130、美国专利申请案7867507、W02003/005816、美国专利5994266)。\n苯甲酸钠\n苯甲酸钠可用于不同的配方中，作为食物制品的抗菌成份，例如，美国专利6,599,514中揭露抗真菌的成份含有抗菌剂和食品添加物，对抗菌成份的活性具有协同效应。在美国专利6599514中揭露的食品添加剂包括山梨酸、山梨酸盐、苯甲酸、苯甲酸盐、羟基苯甲酸盐、二氧化硫和亚硫酸盐、联苯基和其衍生物、亚硝酸盐、硝酸盐、乳酸、乳酸盐、柠檬酸和柠檬酸盐、酒石酸和酒石酸盐、正磷酸和正磷酸盐、苹果酸盐、己二酸、琥珀酸、1,4-庚糖内酯、烟酸、柠檬酸三铵、柠檬酸铁铵、乙二胺四乙酸二钠钙、甘油、2-、3-和多磷酸盐、脂肪酸(E470)、单-和二甘油酯脂肪酸(E471)酯、单-和二甘油酯脂肪酸、碳酸盐、葡糖酸盐、氯(E92S)、六偏磷酸钠、叔丁基、羟基苯甲醚(BHA)、丁基化羟基甲苯(BHT)(E321)、叔丁基对苯二酚(THBQ)、丙基没食子儿茶素没食子酸酯、葡庚糖酸钙、植酸钙、乙醚、乙二胺四乙酸二氢二钠EDTA、乙酸乙酯、甘油单-、二-和三乙酸、甘氨酸、羟基硬脂精、丙-1,2-二醇和丙烷-2-01和葡庚糖酸钠。\n苯甲酸钠也用于杀虫剂配方中，例如，SC约翰逊(SC Johnson)的美国专利4668507中，将含有苯甲酸钠的杀虫剂放于钢质加压系统中，此系统主要用于抑制腐蚀。美国专利5620678中揭露某种的杀虫剂配方，其中的苯甲酸钠作为缓蚀剂使用。美国专利4731379中揭露的杀虫剂成份中，含有苯甲酸钠作为动物杀蚤洗发精。在所述专利中，苯甲酸钠的使用不是用于促进杀虫剂的效果或稳定产品的化学性质，而是用于动物伤口的愈合治疗。美国专利5017620中的杀虫剂成份含苯甲酸钠和其它已知的防腐剂成份，作为抗菌剂用于稳定储存产品的化学性质。美国专利6841572中揭露某种水溶液，用于治疗活的植物、作物、树木和收获前的水果、蔬菜、叶、茎、根和花，其pH值为4.0到6.5之间，基本上含有效浓度以上的杀真菌和/或杀菌，其一种或一种以上的防腐剂成份，而选自山梨酸、苯甲酸、乳酸、含苯甲酸的钠、钾、钙和铵盐成份，山梨酸、羟甲基氨基乙酸、乳酸和丙酸、甲基、乙基、丙基和丁基化合物，至少一种的阴离子表面活性剂和任选的酸化剂。\n\n\n发明内容\n本发明提供的成份和方法，即用于控制和/或防治一种或一种以上的蜱螨科(节肢动物)、蝇科、果蝇科、花蝇科、蚜科、叉木虱科和拟步行虫科(Tenebrionidae)的害虫，含有或使用某种上清液、滤液和/或提取物，和/或一种或一种以上来自上述色杆菌种的上清液、滤液和/或提取物的成份，特别是含紫色杆菌素的菌株，包括但不限于色杆菌种中的色杆菌皮丝西纳、假紫色色杆菌和色杆菌苏比丝加，而更具体来说，为色杆菌苏比丝加新种，而更具体来说，此新种的色杆菌苏比丝加跟美国专利7,244,607中的NRRLB-30655具有相同的特性。\n具体来说，本发明提供的成份和方法，即用于控制和/或防治一种或一种以上的蜱螨科(节肢动物)、蝇科、果蝇科、花蝇科、蚜科、叉木虱科和拟步行虫科(Tenebrionidae)的害虫，于特定部位(a)含有特定数量的上清液、滤液和/或提取物，和/或一种或一种以上来自上述色杆菌种的上清液、滤液和/或提取物的成份，和(b)另一种杀虫剂物质，特别是杀螨剂和/或杀虫剂，可在特定位置中，有效防治螨虫和/或一种或一种以上属于蝇科、果蝇科、花蝇科、蚜科、叉木虱科、拟步行虫科或金龟子科的害虫。\n在具体实例中，此种蜱螨为叶螨科的螨虫，在更为具体的实例中，此种蜱螨为二斑叶螨(Tetranychus

		"description": "Description\n\n沸石的制造方法\n技术领域\n本发明涉及沸石的制造方法，详细而言，涉及与以往相比能够在短时间内稳定地得到粒径比较大的高结晶性沸石的沸石的制造方法。\n背景技术\n沸石由于其晶体结构形成了多孔材料，因此例如可作为仅使特定分子尺寸的分子通过的分子筛来使用。另外，发挥其能够选择性地吸附或释放特定分子的特性，制成吸附式的冷却机、可调节湿度的空调机等来使用。利用了沸石的冷却机或空调机具有能够以远低于以往类型的冷却机或空调机的能量进行运转、并且还能够利用废热进行运转等优点，已开发了在各种领域中的用途。\n为了应用于这种多样的用途，需要大量生产沸石。但是，现实情况是，只有将沸石原料(沸石前体凝胶)(下文中，为了易于理解，有时将供于水热合成的相当于沸石前体的物质放入括号内表示为沸石前体凝胶，但该表示只不过是为了易于与各个原料(铝源等)区分而有助于理解，并没有改变基础申请的含义)放入高压釜中并以间歇方式进行制造的方法得到了实用化，由于成本和生产率的问题，导致制造成本昂贵。并且，这成为尽管沸石的能量效率优异却未得到广泛普及的原因。\n以往，以提高沸石的生产率为目的，开发了各种连续制造沸石的方法。例如，在专利文献1中，关于导入微波合成法作为缩短水热合成的根本性问题即长时间的结晶化过程的一环、通过合成溶液中的水和离子的活化可缩短合成时间的技术，记载了如下内容：通过60～1200W的微波加热，能够在5分钟以内合成沸石。另外，还一并记载了通过添加0～20％的分子筛、能够缩短制造时间的效果。但是，在使用微波的情况下，由于微波无法透过不锈钢等金属，因此，不得不在反应器的局部使用氟树脂等材料。这样的树脂材料在高压下实施的水热合成中存在安全上的问题。\n另一方面，在非专利文献1中，作为在利用热介质进行了加热的管型反应器中连续合成沸石的方法，记载了使用不锈钢毛细管反应器、通过油浴加热来连续合成硅沸石的示例。根据该方法，利用加热至150℃的不锈钢毛细管反应器，能够以5.8分钟的停留时间连续地合成硅沸石。但是，利用该方法进行合成时，所得到的沸石的粒径小至10～100nm，存在难以通过过滤等通常的固液分离法进行回收的问题。而且，所得到的沸石含有大量非晶成分，结晶性差，品质低。\n另外，在专利文献2中，也记载了在利用热介质进行了加热的管型反应器中连续合成沸石的方法。在此，例如在第[0046]、[0047]段中，记载了如下内容：在管型反应器内发生紊流，由此促进反应，从而能够高效地进行沸石的生成反应。\n在非专利文献2中，示出了使用在油浴中被加热的直径6mm的管型反应器来合成A型沸石、Y型沸石、silicalite-1沸石的示例。但是，如非专利文献2所示，在想要使用直径为3cm以下的管型反应器来连续合成沸石的情况下，连续合成的应用仅限于以A型沸石、Y型沸石为代表的、由不使用模板剂(template)的低粘度的原料混合物(沸石前体凝胶)结晶化而成的沸石；或者以silicalite-1沸石为代表的由低粘度的透明溶液结晶化而成的沸石。另外，从结晶化的容易性的方面出发，连续合成的应用也仅限于不需要模板剂那样的容易合成的A型沸石、Y型沸石，或者骨架密度高且容易结晶化的silicalite-1沸石(MFI型、骨架密度)等。但是，在由含有铝、磷的原料混合物(沸石前体凝胶)结晶化出沸石的情况下以及由包含模板剂的硅铝酸盐混合物(沸石前体凝胶)结晶化出沸石的情况下，由于原料混合物(沸石前体凝胶)为高粘度，因此不存在通过使用通常的热介质的加热方法在直径为3cm以下的管型反应器中连续合成的示例。\n从结晶化的困难性的方面出发，认为骨架密度低、即结晶内的空间多的沸石也难以利用上述方法连续地合成。如此认为的理由之一在于，考虑到如上述专利文献2所暗示的那样水热合成中的原料(沸石前体凝胶)的搅拌很重要，认为无法使用粘度高的原料(沸石前体凝胶)来制作沸石；另一个理由在于，认为在粘度高的原料(沸石前体凝胶)中合成沸石时反应管容易闭塞。\n现有技术文献\n专利文献\n专利文献1：日本特开2002-186849号公报\n专利文献2：日本特开2002-137917号公报\n非专利文献\n非专利文献1：Chem.Eng.Technol.32(2009),No.5,732-737\n非专利文献2：Proceedings of the 12th International Zeolite ConferenceIII,(1998),1553-1560\n发明内容\n发明所要解决的课题\n通过本发明人的研究发现：在利用专利文献2记载的方法实际进行沸石、特别是在骨架结构中至少含有铝原子和磷原子的磷铝酸盐沸石或5≤SiO2/Al2O3≤2000(摩尔比)的硅铝酸盐沸石的制造时，反应时间需要数小时，无法充分获得连续制造的优点。\n因此，本发明的课题在于提供一种在管型反应器中连续制造沸石的方法，该方法能够在短时间内高效地制造高结晶性且经过粒径生长的、在骨架结构至少含有铝原子和磷原子的磷铝酸盐沸石或5≤SiO2/Al2O3≤2000(摩尔比)的硅铝酸盐沸石。需要说明的是，在以下的说明书中，有时将在骨架结构中至少含有铝原子和磷原子的磷铝酸盐沸石或5≤SiO2/Al2O3≤2000(摩尔比)的硅铝酸盐沸石仅简称为“沸石”。\n[用于解决课题的手段]\n本发明人进行了深入研究，结果发现了在管型反应器中连续制造“沸石”时通过专利文献1记载的那种现有的水热合成法无法实现的、能够在短时间内制作“沸石”的水热合成法。另外还发现，与专利文献2记载的由紊流带来的搅拌相比，在短时间内进行充分加热时，能够在短时间内得到优质且在后续工序中容易分离的足够大的“沸石”。具体而言，想到了：通过使管型反应器的容积、即供于合成的原料的量与用于供给热的表面积之比为特定的范围，能够在短时间内进行充分的加热。\n另外还发现，此时，若添加与想要制造的“沸石”为相同类型的“沸石”作为籽晶，则能够防止“沸石”的连续制造中产生不规则的压力变动。认为该压力变动起因于由“沸石”快速产生、生长而引起的固液相之比的变动和管的暂时性闭塞，因此，抑制该压力变动对于防止因管的闭塞导致的“沸石”生产效率的变差、提高所得到的“沸石”的结晶性、粒度分布等品质的稳定性、延长管型反应器的管的寿命、通过减小厚度来提高能量效率等在实际生产中的改善效果大。\n另外，通过添加籽晶，还可发挥如下效果，即，不易产生在不添加籽晶时产生的如下问题：过量地生成多数的成为结晶生长起点的微细结晶，其结果，所得到的“沸石”的颗粒变得过小；或者，相反地，未充分产生作为生长起点的核，结果得到了粗大的“沸石”；等等，所得到的“沸石”的粒度分布得到改善。\n进而，本发明人还发现，沸石的合成经历了4个阶段，即，(1)原料溶解而形成溶液的阶段、(2)以约10个单元形成沸石的基本结构的亚单元(下文中有时表记为“SB单元”)形成阶段、(3)其进一步生长而形成非晶的阶段、(4)结晶化的阶段。并且得到了如下技术构思：在该4个阶段之中，从(2)SB单元形成阶段至(3)非晶形成阶段，产生粘度高的块，从而引起反应管的闭塞等问题。进而得到了如下技术构思：在(4)结晶化的阶段，与至此为止的3个阶段相比，即使温度、压力均低，反应也可进行。由这些技术构思想到了，通过在(3)形成非晶的阶段中进一步添加沸石前体凝胶，能够防止从最开始便将原料浓度设定得较高时发生的反应管的闭塞，且能够改善由原料浓度低引起的沸石合成效率的低下。另外还发现，只要达到超过非晶的阶段的状态，之后即使在温度、压力均比之前的阶段低的状态下也能够进行结晶化反应，能够得到结晶性高的“沸石”。\n本发明是基于这样的技术构思而达成的，其要点如下。\n[1]一种沸石的制造方法，其为向管型反应器中连续地供给原料(沸石前体凝胶)来连续地制造在骨架结构中至少含有铝原子和磷原子的磷铝酸盐沸石或5≤SiO2/Al2O3≤2000的硅铝酸盐沸石的方法，其特征在于，\n该管型反应器使用热介质进行加热，该管型反应器的体积(内容量)与侧面表面积之比、即(体积)/(侧面表面积)为0.75cm以下，并且在该原料(沸石前体凝胶)中添加籽晶。\n[2]如[1]所述的沸石的制造方法，其中，在上述原料(沸石前体凝胶)中添加模板剂。\n[3]如[1]或[2]所述的沸石的制造方法，其中，将供给至上述管型反应器的上述原料加热后，向该管型反应器中进一步添加沸石前体凝胶，使得沸石前体凝胶与加热后的原料接触。\n[4]如[1]～[3]中任一项所述的沸石的制造方法，其特征在于，在连续地制造上述沸石的方法中，该沸石的由IZA规定的沸石结构为AFI。\n[5]如[1]～[3]所述的沸石的制造方法，其特征在于，在连续地制造上述沸石的方法中，该沸石的由IZA规定的沸石结构为CHA。\n[6]如[1]～[5]中任一项所述的沸石的制造方法，其特征在于，上述原料(沸石前体凝胶)被熟化了2小时以上。\n[7]如[1]～[6]中任一项所述的沸石的制造方法，其特征在于，在连续地制造上述沸石的方法中，该沸石的骨架密度为以上且以下。\n[8]如[1]～[7]中任一项所述的沸石的制造方法，其特征在于，在连续地制造上述沸石的方法中，该沸石含有过渡金属。\n[9]一种沸石的制造方法，其为向管型反应器中供给原料(沸石前体凝胶)并将原料(沸石前体凝胶)加热从而连续地制造在骨架结构中至少含有铝原子和磷原子的磷铝酸盐沸石或5≤SiO2/Al2O3≤2000(摩尔比)的硅铝酸盐沸石的方法，其特征在于，\n使该管型反应器的直径为3cm以下，并且在该原料(沸石前体凝胶)中添加籽晶。\n[10]如[1]～[9]中任一项所述的沸石的制造方法，其特征在于，上述管型反应器包括具有可开闭的盖的独立的管型反应器，向该管型反应器中供给原料(沸石前体凝胶)，关闭该盖后，将该管型反应器投入到热介质中进行加热，然后，从热介质中取出该管型反应器，打开该盖，取出产物。\n[11]如[1]～[9]中任一项所述的沸石的制造方法，其中，上述管型反应器包括具有可开闭的盖的独立的管型反应器，向该管型反应器中供给原料，关闭该盖后，将该管型反应器投入到热介质中进行加热，然后，从热介质中取出该管型反应器，打开该盖，取出产物，将该产物在比反应时低的温度下保持。\n[12]一种沸石的制造装置，其为具有至少一个以上的原料槽、籽晶槽、回流液槽和管型反应器的沸石的制造装置，\n该沸石的制造装置包括：\n使来自该原料槽的原料(沸石前体凝胶)、来自该籽晶槽的籽晶和来自该回流液槽的回流以适当的比例合流并供给至该管型反应器的单元、\n保持有用于对该管型反应器进行加热的热介质的加热槽、\n对生成的沸石进行分离的单元、以及\n使沸石分离后的残留原料返回至该回流液槽的单元，\n该管型反应器的体积(内容量)与侧面表面积之比、即(体积)/(侧面表面积)为0.75cm以下。\n另外，本发明还包含以下要点。\n[13]如[8]所述的沸石的制造方法，其特征在于，上述过渡金属为选自铜、铁和锡中的1种或2种以上。\n[14]一种丙烯的制造方法，其特征在于，以通过[1]～[11]和[13]中任一项所述的制造方法得到的沸石作为催化剂、以乙烯作为原料来制造丙烯。\n[15]一种废气处理用催化剂的制造方法，其特征在于，以通过[1]～[11]和[13]中任一项所述的制造方法得到的沸石作为催化剂，用于废气的净化。\n[16]一种废气处理装置，其以通过[1]～[11]和[13]中任一项所述的制造方法得到的沸石作为催化剂。\n[17]如[10]或[11]所述的沸石的制造方法，其中，该管型反应器为多个。\n[18]一种沸石的制造方法，其为向使用热介质进行了加热的管型反应器中连续地供给原料(沸石前体凝胶)来连续地制造在骨架结构中至少含有铝原子和磷原子的磷铝酸盐沸石或5≤SiO2/Al2O3≤2000的硅铝酸盐沸石的方法，其特征在于，\n使该管型反应器的直径为3cm以下，并且在该原料(沸石前体凝胶)中添加籽晶。\n发明的效果\n根据本发明，通过可在工业上实施的“沸石”的连续制造，能够在短时间内稳定且高效地制造高结晶性且经过粒径生长的“沸石”。\n附图说明\n图1是示出本发明的“沸石”的制造方法中使用的装置的一例的示意图。\n图2是示出图1的装置的管型反应器部分的示意图。\n图3是示出适合于向在管型反应器中加热后的原料中进一步添加沸石前体凝胶的情况的管型反应器部分的一例的示意图。\n图4是实施例1中得到的AlPO沸石和比较例1中得到的AlPO沸石的XRD图谱。\n图5是示出实施例1中在添加了籽晶的情况下向反应器施加的压力变动的状态的曲线图。\n图6是示出比较例1中在未添加籽晶的情况下向反应器施加的压力变动的状态的曲线图。\n图7是实施例1中得到的AlPO沸石的扫描型电子显微镜照片。\n图8是实施例2中得到的AlPO沸石的XRD图谱。\n图9是实施例3中得到的硅铝酸盐沸石的XRD图谱。\n图10是实施例3中得到的硅铝酸盐沸石的扫描型电子显微镜照片。\n图11是实施例4中得到的硅铝酸盐沸石的XRD图谱。\n图12是实施例4中得到的硅铝酸盐沸石的扫描型电子显微镜照片。\n图13是实施例5中得到的硅铝酸盐沸石的XRD图谱。\n图14是实施例5中得到的硅铝酸盐沸石的扫描型电子显微镜照片。\n图15是实施例6中得到的硅铝酸盐沸石的XRD图谱。\n图16是实施例6中得到的硅铝酸盐沸石的扫描型电子显微镜照片。\n具体实施方式\n以下，对本发明的实施方式进行详细说明，但以下说明为本发明的实施方式的一例(代表例)，本发明并不限定于这些内容。\n本发明的“沸石”的制造方法是向使用热介质进行了加热的管型反应器中连续地供给原料(沸石前体凝胶)来连续地制造“沸石”的方法，其特征在于，使所使用的管型反应器的体积(内容量)与侧面表面积之比、即(体积)/(侧面表面积)为0.75cm以下，在原料(沸石前体凝胶)中添加籽晶。\n本发明的“沸石”的制造方法中，使用体积(内容量)与侧面表面积之比、即(体积)/(侧面表面积)为0.75cm以下的管型反应器(在直管的情况下，相当于直径为3cm以下)，在原料(沸石前体凝胶)中添加籽晶，除此以外，可以按照常规方法来进行，通过对含有构成“沸石”的原子的原料化合物和优选进一步含有模板剂的原料(沸石前体凝胶)进行水热合成来制造“沸石”。即，在原料(沸石前体凝胶)中含有籽晶，更优选在原料(沸石前体凝胶)中进一步含有模板剂。需要说明的是，在水热合成之前，可以对“沸石”的制造中使用的原料(原料化合物)(下文中，为了易于理解，有时将最初为了制造本发明的“沸石”而准备的、与“沸石”的材料相当的物质放入括号内表示为原料化合物，但该表示只不过是为了有助于理解，并没有改变基础申请的含义)进行熟化。\n另外，本发明中，“连续地”包括表示基本不间断而连续的方式的情况和每隔一定间隔连续地进行的方式。\n[管型反应器]\n首先，对本发明中使用的管型反应器进行说明。\n本发明中使用的管型反应器是在一端具有原料(沸石前体凝胶)的入口、在另一端具有产物的出口的管状反应器，利用热介质对其进行加热。该管型反应器的体积(内容量)与侧面表面积之比、即(体积)/(侧面表面积)为0.75cm以下，优选为0.5cm以下，特别优选为0.25cm以下，最优选为0.13cm以下。\n管型反应器的体积(内容量)与侧面表面积之比、即(体积)/(侧面表面积)越小，越能够在短时间内对原料(沸石前体凝胶)整体进行充分加热，越能够高速地进行反应，另一方面，(体积)/(侧面表面积)不会过小时，引起闭塞等麻烦的可能小。需要说明的是，接受来自热介质的热的面积可以用管型反应器的外径来表示，因此，若用管的直径(外径)来表示该关系，则为直径3cm以下。另外，闭塞是在管型反应器的内部产生的现象，因此，管型反应器的内径的下限优选为1mm以上，更优选为2mm以上。在管型反应器的截面(与管轴向正交的截面)不为圆形的情况下，为了易于思考，可以将该截面的面积等效直径思考为直径。\n在本发明的一个方式中，管型反应器是在一端具有原料(沸石前体凝胶)的入口、在另一端具有产物的出口的管状反应器，利用热介质对其进行加热。该管型反应器的直径(内径)为3cm以下，优选为2cm以下，特别优选为1cm以下，最优选为5mm以下。本发明中，管型反应器的直径的下限优选为1mm以上，更优选为2mm以上。\n管型反应器的直径越小，越能够在短时间内对原料(沸石前体凝胶)整体进行充分加热，越能够高速地进行反应，另一方面，管型反应器的直径不会过小时，引起闭塞等麻烦的可能小。需要说明的是，在管型反应器的截面(与管轴向正交的截面)不为圆形的情况下，可以将该截面的面积等效径思考为直径。\n本方式的本质在于在短时间内对原料(沸石前体凝胶)整体进行加热，也可以利用与原料(沸石前体凝胶)的体积相当的反应器的内容量与用于接受来自于外部的热介质的热能的管型反应器的表面积之比来表示。在管型反应器的截面为圆形的情况下，在将其内径设为d(直径)时，内容量为πd2/4×反应器的长度，另一方面，管型反应器的表面积(在此，表面积是指反应器的侧周面的面积)为πd×反应器的长度。因此，该比为(πd2/4×反应器的长度)/(πd×反应器的长度)＝d/4。如上所述可知，为了使用管型反应器快速进行反应，可以使管型反应器的直径(内径)为3cm以下，因此，该d/4的值为0.75以下。d/4更优选为0.5以下，特别优选为0.25以下。\n如上所述，本发明的本质在于在短时间内对原料(沸石前体凝胶)整体进行加热，可以利用与原料(沸石前体凝胶)的体积相当的反应器的内容量与用于接受来自于外部的热介质的热能的管型反应器的表面积之比来表示。需要说明的是，本发明中，为方便起见，可以使外径＝内径＝直径来求出管型反应器的内容量与侧面表面积之比。在使外径＝内径＝直径来进行计算的情况下，内容量估算得要比实际的内容量大。即，本发明的(内容量)与(侧面表面积)之比估算得较大。另外，本发明的管型反应器的厚度可以设定得较薄，因此，即使按照外径＝内径＝直径来确定(内容量)与(侧面表面积)之比，本发明也不会无法实施。本发明中，在管型反应器的截面为圆形的情况下，若使内径＝外径＝直径，则将其直径设为d时，内容量为πd2/4×反应器的长度，另一方面，管型反应器的表面积(在此，表面积是指反应器的侧周面的面积)为πd×反应器的长度。因此，该比为(πd2/4×反应器的长度)/(πd×反应器的长度)＝d/4[cm]。本发明人发现，通过使管型反应器的直径为3cm以下，可使用管型反应器使沸石的生成反应快速进行。并且，在管型反应器的直径为3cm的情况下，该d/4[cm]的值为0.75cm。即，即使壁厚为零该比值也为0.75cm，因此(内容量)与(侧面表面积)之比d/4为0.75以下。d/4[cm]更优选为0.5cm以下，特别优选为0.25cm以下。另外，d/4[cm]优选为0.025cm以上，更优选为0.05cm以上。\n根据该定义，即使管型反应器的截面为偏离圆形的不规则形状，也能够容易地判断出能在短时间内制造沸石的条件。若考虑截面为长a、宽2a的长方形的方筒形状的反应器的情况作为例示，则内容量为(2a×a×反应器的长度)，与此相对，表面积为(6a×反应器的长度)，因此，为了使该比为0.75以下，只要使内容量/表面积＝a/3为0.75cm以下即可。因此可知，只要使a为2.25cm以下即可。\n另外，作为本发明的另一把握方式，通过使用供于反应的“沸石”原料(沸石前体凝胶)中含有籽晶、并且在管型反应器内存在的全部籽晶与反应器内壁的最短距离(从籽晶至反应器内壁的垂线长度)处于1.5cm以内的距离的管型反应器，能够在短时间内将整体加热，能够在短时间内连续地制造“沸石”。该距离更优选为1cm以下，进一步优选为0.5cm以下。在此，说明的是籽晶，但由于籽晶分散在原料(沸石前体凝胶)中，因此，也可以解读为原料(沸石前体凝胶)。\n另外，为了维持管型反应器的强度，优选管型反应器的厚度为一定厚度以上的厚度，另一方面，为了减少用于管型反应器本身的加热的热能量，优选管型反应器的厚度薄。因此，管型反应器的厚度优选为0.2mm以上，并且优选为5mm以下。在本发明中，基于使用籽晶所带来的管型反应器的压力变动的抑制效果，具有能够将管型反应器的厚度设定得较薄来提高加热效率的优点。\n管型反应器的长度没有特别限制，可设计为能够以停留时间的形式确保“沸石”的制造所需要的反应时间的长度。管型反应器的长度通常为5cm以上，优选为10cm以上，其上限通常为10m以下，优选为5m以下，优选相对于管型反应器的直径为5倍以上，特别优选为50倍以上，作为上限，优选为5000倍以下，特别优选为3000倍以下。但是，管型反应器可以超过上述上限而设计得较长，在该情况下，在反应结束后得到的产物在管型反应器内流通的期间，使后述的加热槽的热容量增加，由此能够使温度等稳定化。特别是在管型反应器的直径为10mm以下的情况下，从能够大大减小反应器闭塞的危险性的方面考虑，优选使管型反应器的长度为5m以下，更优选为3m以下。\n这种细径长条的管型反应器通常卷绕为线圈状来使用。此时通过内部的原料的流动方向若存在沿着与重力相反的方向行进的部分，则此处容易闭塞，因此，更优选使线圈卷绕的面接近于水平，使得原料从高处向低处流动。\n对管型反应器的材质没有特别限制，可以适当使用在反应温度下的耐热性和对“沸石”的污染不存在问题、且热传导良好的材质，特别适合使用不锈钢。通过利用特氟龙(注册商标)等稳定的材料对反应器内进行加衬来防止对“沸石”的污染，也可以将具有良好热传导性的铜、铝作为反应器的材质来使用。\n本发明中，使用热介质对这样的管型反应器进行加热。热介质是为了对装置进行加热且控制于目标温度而用于使热在外部热源与装置之间转移的介质的总称，可以使用每单位体积的热容量、传热系数大、不会腐蚀装置并且在环境、经济性方面也适宜的热介质。作为热介质，例如可以使用油、蒸气、金属块等。空气对流式加热机中的空气包括在热介质中。其中，从具有流动性、热容量也大的方面考虑，特别优选为液体的加热介质，特别优选为各种油。通过像这样使用热介质对管型反应器进行加热，能够将管型反应器均匀且高效地加热。与此相对，在不使用热介质、例如在使用辐射出微波等电磁波的加热机等的情况下，难以遍及长条的反应器的整个长度加热至均匀的温度，无法得到结晶性高的“沸石”。\n本发明中，通过使“沸石”制造原料(沸石前体凝胶)在利用这样的热介质进行了加热的管型反应器内流通、将原料加热来连续地制造“沸石”，作为此时的原料(沸石前体凝胶)的流量(流通速度)，取决于反应器的尺寸、特别是长度，但优选为0.5ml/分钟以上，更优选为1ml/分钟以上，上限优选为500ml/分钟以下，更优选为100ml/分钟以下。另外，作为管型反应器内的原料(沸石前体凝胶)的停留时间(反应时间)，优选为0.5分钟以上，特别优选为0.8分钟以上，最优选为1分钟以上。另一方面，作为上限，优选为60分钟以下，特别优选为13分钟以下，最优选为3分钟以下。\n停留时间(反应时间)为该范围时，能够以远远短于以往的时间收率良好地、容易且稳定地得到充分尺寸的“沸石”，因而优选。但是，管型反应器的停留时间也可以超过上述上限。另外，流通速度不需要总是保持恒定，也可以断续地流通，该情况下的流速按照在管型反应器中通过的期间内的平均值来考虑即可。另外，本发明中，为了控制粘度并提高单位时间的收率，也有在反应过程中按照与已经开始加热后的原料接触的方式添加原料的方式，该情况下，这些原料的时间、流量可以解读为直到以接触的方式添加为止的时间。\n在本发明中，由于使用如上所述的直径小、即相对于体积而言表面积大的管型反应器和热介质所带来的加热效率的提高，能够缩短反应时间，能够以以往的研究者没有想到的短时间、例如以如上所述的流通速度、反应时间来制造“沸石”。\n反应温度、即管型反应器的加热温度与通常的沸石的水热合成的温度同等即可，作为下限值，通常为100℃以上，优选为120℃以上，更优选为150℃以上。另一方面，上限为300℃以下，优选为250℃以下，更优选为220℃以下，特别优选为160℃以上且200℃以下。该加热温度通过热介质的温度来调节。\n需要说明的是，为了在短时间内高效地对管型反应器进行加热，优选相对于管型反应器的尺寸将热介质的量调节至适当，热介质的用量根据所使用的热介质的种类而不同，但相对于管型反应器的有效体积(反应器内的容积)，优选使参与管型反应器的加热的热介质、即后述的图1、2的装置中的加热槽3内的热介质8为0.5体积倍以上，特别优选为1体积倍以上，并且，优选以5000体积倍以下、特别优选为1000体积倍以下的比例使用。通常，为了迅速地将热能传递至原料(沸石前体凝胶)，优选热介质的量大于被加热的原料(沸石前体凝胶)的量。但是，对热介质进行加热也需要能量，因此，通过设定为例如套管型热交换器这样的结构，能够使热介质的量非常少，因而优选。另外，在“沸石”的合成反应中，优选管型反应器其整体存在于热介质中。\n需要说明的是，关于反应时的压力，只要与通常的水热合成同样为自产生压力即可，但进一步优选在该温度的水蒸气压力的1～1.5倍压力的范围内进行控制。\n压力为上述范围时，能够防止在压力小于该范围时可能会发生的原料化合物的分解所产生的气体成分不连续地喷出、或者流路因一部分固体(粘度高的块)而闭塞的情况，能够更稳定地运转。\n另外，从安全上考虑，优选使压力小于上述上限值。\n根据使用这样的利用热介质进行加热的管型反应器、如后所述使含有籽晶的“沸石”制造原料(沸石前体凝胶)发生反应的本发明的“沸石”的制造方法，能够在短时间内高效地连续制造结晶性高、并且粒径比较大、粒度分布也良好的“沸石”。\n另外，如上所述，为了防止管型反应器的闭塞且得到大量的“沸石”，还优选在正在被加热的原料、即反应过程中的中间产物中补充添加原料(沸石前体凝胶)。为了像这样按照与加热后原料接触的方式添加原料(沸石前体凝胶)，优选连接用于在管型反应器的过程中补充供给原料(沸石前体凝胶)的管。关于在该反应过程中补充的原料(沸石前体凝胶)的浓度，只要处于比反应过程中形成了SB单元或非晶状态的原料低的粘度就没有特别限定，另外，也可以是不含有籽晶的水性凝胶，但优选使用与供给至管型反应器的原料(沸石前体凝胶)相同的原料。在此，所谓按照与加热后原料接触的方式添加，不是单纯的原料的连续供给，而是添加至反应过程中的SB单元和/或非晶状态的原料中。即，是指添加至与作为原料的沸石前体凝胶相比粘度增加的状态的中间产物中。由此，能够进一步得到“沸石”的生长和粘度的降低这两种效果。\n另外，作为本发明的另一方式，也可以通过在上述特征即管型反应器的体积(内容量)与侧面表面积之比、即(体积)/(侧面表面积)为0.75cm以下的管型反应器中反应至非晶状态后取出并置于比管型反应器中的加热温度低的温度和压力下来制造结晶性高的“沸石”。这种情况下，从管型反应器取出的含有非晶状态的沸石的液体(下文中，在本说明书中也有时表记为“中间液”)保持于温度压力比管型反应器中的温度压力低的状态下即可，通常保持于180℃以下，优选保持于160℃以下，特别优选保持于100℃以下。在本发明的实施方式中，这样的在100℃以下、即不需要加压的1个大气压的条件下可以得到结晶性高的沸石也是一大效果。从提高结晶性的方面考虑，保持温度的下限值优选为70℃以上，更优选为80℃以上，保持时间优选为10小时以上，更优选为1天以上。该保持时间根据反应过程中补充的原料的比例、补充的位置来适当优化即可。在使用该制造方法的情况下，具有如下优点：能够将管型反应器的长度设定得较短，能够使设备进一步紧凑。也可以进一步在取出产物后的管型反应器中投入新的原料，连续地制造沸石。在这样连续制造沸石的情况下，由于原料是投入到温热的管型反应器中，因此还具有加热所需要的热量少的优点。\n本发明中制造的“沸石”中，作为利用后述的实施例一项所记载的方法测定的结晶度，通常为75％以上，更优选为80％以上，并且，作为利用后述的实施例一项所记载的方法测定的模板剂除去前的平均粒径，优选为0.1μm以上，更优选为1μm以上，特别优选为2μm以上。另一方面，平均粒径的上限没有特别限定，优选为100μm以下，更优选为50μm以下。\n从管型反应器的出口流出的产物为如上所述的含有所生成的“沸石”的浆料，对其进行固液分离，根据需要进行水洗和干燥，进一步根据需要通过煅烧等除去模板剂后供于使用。\n在从该产物浆料中固液分离出“沸石”时，由于本发明中制造的“沸石”的粒径比较大，因此可以利用过滤法、沉淀法等容易地进行固液分离。\n[沸石的制造装置]\n参照图1～3对本发明的沸石的制造方法中使用的“沸石”的制造装置的一例进行说明，但本发明中可采用的装置并不受图1～3所示的装置的任何限定。\n在图1所示的装置中，来自水性凝胶槽1的水性凝胶与来自籽晶槽2的籽晶分别经过配管11、12和配管13并生成沸石前体凝胶，被导入至加热槽3内的管型反应器3A(位于加热槽3内，在图1中未图示)中，管型反应器3A的反应产物经过配管14被导入至过滤槽4中，所生成的“沸石”被过滤分离，滤液由配管17被排出到体系外；或者，为了未反应物的回收、再利用，使其中的一部分或全部由配管16经过回流液槽6回流至管型反应器3A的入口侧。作为加热槽3，如图2所示，使用容纳有作为对管型反应器3A进行加热的热介质8的油浴等的加热槽。5是用于加热热介质8的加热器，该热介质8用于对管型反应器3A进行加热，加热器5以将利用配管5B从加热槽3抽出的热介质加热并利用配管5A返回至加热槽3的方式构成。需要说明的是，加热槽3的热介质8除了像这样利用外部的加热器5进行加热以外，还可以利用直接安装在加热槽3中的加热单元来进行加热。另外，可以在加热槽3的前段设置用于将来自水性凝胶槽1的水性凝胶、来自籽晶槽2的籽晶以及根据需要回流的未反应物进行混合的混合槽。图1中，11A、12A、16A分别为开闭阀。需要说明的是，例如也可以设定为从籽晶槽2向水性凝胶槽1供给籽晶而制成沸石前体的方式等。\n图2所示的管型反应器3A以线圈部为圆形的方式卷绕为线圈状，但也可以以线圈部为四边形的方式卷绕，另外还可以为锯齿状。另外，管型反应器3A也可以为直线状。另外，也可以将多个管型反应器3A大致平行地配置，对于进行水热反应之后的部分，将其汇总为1根；或者，也可以相反地使水热反应之前的部分为较粗的状态，仅使发生水热反应的部分的外径为3cm以下。\n在图1～图3的装置中，来自水性凝胶槽1的水性凝胶(原料混合物)和来自籽晶槽2的籽晶分别以规定的比例被供给至管型反应器3A，添加有籽晶的水性凝胶的“沸石”原料(沸石前体凝胶)在利用热介质8被加热的管型反应器3A内流通的期间进行水热合成。\n通过水热合成生成的含有“沸石”的反应产物接着在过滤槽4中进行固液分离，生成的沸石被回收。\n需要说明的是，通过使滤液的一部分或全部经过回流液槽6回流至管型反应器3A并再次供于水热合成，能够将未反应物回收、再利用，能够提高“沸石”的收率。另外，在按照与加热后原料接触的方式在反应过程中补充原料的类型的装置的情况下，为了能够使所补充的原料合流，优选使用如图3所示在管型反应器的中途具备配管20的装置。\n在图1～图3中，示出了原料(沸石前体凝胶)在管型反应器3A中流动而生成“沸石”的类型的制造装置，但也可以通过除此以外的连续方法进行制造，例如，准备多个带盖的短的管型反应器，向其中填塞原料(沸石前体凝胶)，关闭盖后，逐个浸渍到热介质中，由此对原料(沸石前体凝胶)进行加热，将加热规定时间后的反应器从热介质中取出，打开盖取出内容物，利用过滤等固液分离法将反应完毕的“沸石”与未反应物分离，由此连续地制造所期望的“沸石”。在使用该类型进行制造的情况下，能够避免管闭塞等麻烦，能够使管型反应器的内径较细，能够进一步缩短反应时间。另外，在利用相同的装置少量多品种地制造不同类型的沸石(不限于本发明的“沸石”)这样的、品种的变换多的情况下，从能够准备各沸石的种类专用的管型反应器、管型反应器的清洗容易且在使用完毕的管型反应器清洗中能够利用其他的管型反应器生产其他种类的沸石等方面出发，优选使用短的管型反应器的该方法。在使用该方法的情况下，管型反应器的长度从效率的方面考虑优选为5cm以上，从处理的方面考虑优选为1m以下，其他的管型反应器的尺寸、温度、反应时间、使用的籽晶、加热槽等各条件与原料(沸石前体凝胶)在管型反应器中流动的情况相同。当然，也可以至SB单元形成阶段为止在管型反应器内进行水热合成，之后，如上所述将其取出，保持在与水热反应时相比低温、低压的条件下，由此制造高结晶性的沸石。\n[沸石]\n接着对本发明中制造的优选的沸石进行说明。\n本发明中制造的沸石(下文中有时称为本发明的“沸石”)有利于在吸附式冷却机、空调机、各种吸附元件等广泛的用途中应用，因此，其为在骨架结构中至少含有铝原子和磷原子的磷铝酸盐(ALPO)沸石、或者在骨架结构中至少含有铝原子和硅原子且5≤SiO2/Al2O3≤2000(摩尔比)的硅铝酸盐沸石。另外，该“沸石”的骨架密度优选为以上且以下。另外，该“沸石”的由IZA(International Zeolite Association，国际沸石协会)规定的沸石结构优选为AFI、CHA。\nALPO沸石中，构成骨架结构的铝原子和磷原子可以被过渡金属等其他原子取代。其中，从吸附特性的方面考虑，优选：I)铝原子被杂原子(Me1：其中，Me1表示属于周期表第三周期或第四周期的选自2族、7族、8族、11族、12族、13族(除Al以外)的元素中的至少一种元素)部分取代的Me-磷铝酸盐；II)磷原子被杂原子(Me2：其中，Me2为属于周期表第三周期～第五周期的14族元素)取代的Me-磷铝酸盐；III)铝原子和磷原子这两者被杂原子(分别为Me1、Me2)取代的Me-磷铝酸盐。\n本发明的“沸石”中，杂原子Me可以仅含有1种，也可以含有2种以上。优选的Me(Me1、Me2)为属于周期表第三周期、第四周期的元素。特别优选Me1为2价的状态并且离子半径为0.3nm以上且8nm以下，进一步优选为2价且4配位的状态并且离子半径为0.4nm以上且7nm以下。作为杂原子Me1，在上述之中，从合成的容易性、作为吸附元件使用时的吸附特性的方面考虑，优选为选自铜、铁、钴、镁、锌、锡中的至少一种元素，更优选为选自铜、铁和锡中的1种或2种以上，特别优选为铁。Me2为属于周期表第三周期或第四周期的14族元素，优选为硅原子。\n构成“沸石”的骨架结构的Me、Al和P的构成比例(摩尔比)通常为下式1-1～3-1的摩尔比，优选为下式1-2～3-2的摩尔比。\n0≤x≤0.3                            …1-1\n(x表示Me相对于Me、Al、P的合计的摩尔比)\n0.2≤y≤0.6                          …2-1\n(y表示Al相对于Me、Al、P的合计的摩尔比)\n0.3≤z≤0.6                          …3-1\n(z表示P相对于Me、Al、P的合计的摩尔比)\n0.01≤x≤0.3                         …1-2\n(x表示Me相对于Me、Al、P的合计的摩尔比)\n0.3≤y≤0.5                          …2-2\n(y表示Al相对于Me、Al、P的合计的摩尔比)\n0.4≤z≤0.5                          …3-2\n(z表示P相对于Me、Al、P的合计的摩尔比)\nX小于上述范围时，在作为吸附元件使用的情况下，有如下倾向：被吸附物在压力低的区域的吸附量减小，或者难以合成；X大于上述范围时，在合成时有容易混入杂质的倾向。另外，y、z为上述范围外时，难以合成。\n另外，在本发明的“沸石”为硅铝酸盐沸石的情况下，骨架结构内的硅原子、铝原子的一部分(在铝原子的情况下可以为全部)可以被其他原子、例如镁、钛、锆、钒、铬、锰、铁、钴、锌、镓、锡、硼等原子取代。在硅铝酸盐沸石的情况下，若硅原子与铝原子(铝原子+杂原子)的摩尔比过小，则优先生成A型沸石、Y型沸石等，无法得到所期望的“沸石”。另外，上述摩尔比过大时，“沸石”的结晶化变慢。因此，本发明中使用的沸石的SiO2/Al2O3的摩尔比通常为5以上，优选为10以上，更优选为15以上。另外，作为上限，为2000以下，优选为1000以下，更优选为500以下。关于该SiO2/Al2O3，按照沸石领域的惯例，利用ICP发射光谱分析、荧光X射线分析等组成分析对硅原子与铝原子的原子数的比进行测定，并将其以氧化物之比的形式来表示。\n这些“沸石”包括具有可交换的阳离子种的沸石，作为该情况下的阳离子种，可以举出质子、Li、Na等碱元素、Mg、Ca等碱土元素、La、Ce等稀土元素、Fe、Co、Ni等过渡金属等，优选质子、碱元素、碱土元素、稀土元素。进一步更优选质子、Li、Na、K、Mg、Ca。\n另外，本发明的“沸石”的骨架密度(骨架密度：FD)优选为以上且以下，特别是下限值优选为以上，特别优选为以上。在此，骨架密度的值为Ch.Baerlocher等在ATLAS OF ZEOLITE FRAMEWORK TYPES(SixthRevised Edition,2007,ELSEVIER)中记载的值，是指每的单位体积内存在的T原子(每沸石的构成骨架的氧原子以外的原子数)，是表示骨架密度的单位。“沸石”的骨架密度为上述下限值以上时，结构稳定，耐久性提高。另一方面，为上述上限值以下时，吸附容量增大，适合作为吸附材料等使用。\n另外，作为“沸石”的结构，按照IZA(International Zeolite Association，国际沸石协会)规定的代码，可以举出LTA、FER、MFI、FAU、DDR、NSI、ACO、AEI、AEL、AET、AFG、AFI、AFN、AFR、AFS、AFT、AFX、AFY、AST、ATN、ATO、ATS、ATT、AWW、*BEA、BEC、BOG、BPH、BRE、CAN、CGF、CGS、CHA、CON、CZP、DFO、DFT、DON、EAB、EDI、EMT、EON、ERI、ESV、ETR、EZT、FAR、FRA、GIS、GIU、GME、HEU、IFR、ISV、ITE、IWR、IWV、IWW、KFI、LEV、LIO、LOS、MAR、MAZ、MEI、MER、MOR、MOZ、MSE、MWW、NAB、OBW、OFF、OSO、OWE、PAU、PHI、RHO、RSN、RTE、RTH、SAO、SAS、SAT、SAV、SBE、SBS、SBT、SFF、SFO、SIV、SOD、SOS、STF、STI、STT、TER、TOL、TSC、UFI、UOZ、USI、UTL、VFI、VNI、VSV、-WEN、ZON，其中，本发明的沸石从吸附特性、耐久性的方面考虑，优选为选自AEI、AEL、AFI、CHA、LEV中的任意一种，特别优选为AFI、CHA，尤其优选为AFI。\n另外，本发明的“沸石”的平均粒径优选为0.1μm以上，更优选为1μm以上，进一步优选为2μm以上。另一方面，作为上限，优选为100μm以下，特别优选为50μm以下。根据本发明的“沸石”的制造方法，如上所述，作为模板剂除去前的“沸石”，能够制造平均粒径为2～50μm的粒径比较大的“沸石”，因此，可以根据需要将所制造的“沸石”粉碎、整粒后来使用。\n[水性凝胶]\n接着对作为本发明的“沸石”的制造中使用的原料的水性凝胶进行说明。\n<原料>\n在通过水热合成来制造本发明的磷铝酸盐沸石的情况下，作为原料的水性凝胶(原料混合物)通常通过将铝源、磷源、根据需要使用的Fe等Me源以及模板剂进行混合来制备。当然，只要不妨碍本发明的效果，该水性凝胶也可以含有其他成分，例如像在对本发明中可采用的装置进行说明时所说明过的那样，在使未反应物回流的情况下，也可以含有籽晶等。这在后述的硅铝酸盐沸石的原料的情况下也同样。\n铝源(用于供给铝的原料化合物)没有特别限定，通常可以举出假勃姆石、异丙醇铝、三乙醇铝等铝醇盐、氢氧化铝、氧化铝溶胶、铝酸钠等中的1种或2种以上，假勃姆石由于容易处理且反应性高而优选。\n作为磷源(用于供给磷的原料化合物)，通常使用磷酸，但也可以使用磷酸铝。\nMe是指上述本发明的“沸石”的说明中的杂原子，优选为Si、Fe、Co、Mg、Zn等。作为Me源(用于供给Me的原料化合物)，通常使用它们的硫酸盐、硝酸盐、磷酸盐等无机酸盐、乙酸盐、草酸盐等有机酸盐、或者有机金属化合物。根据情况，也可以使用胶体状的氢氧化物等。\n其中，作为Si源(用于供给Si的原料化合物)，可以使用气相二氧化硅、硅溶胶、胶态二氧化硅、水玻璃、硅酸乙酯、硅酸甲酯等。这些Me源可以单独使用1种，也可以混合使用2种以上。\n作为用作磷铝酸盐沸石的原料(原料化合物)的模板剂，可以举出四甲基铵、四乙基铵、四丙基铵、四丁基铵等四烷基铵；吗啉、二正丙胺、三正丙胺、三异丙胺、三乙胺、三乙醇胺、哌啶、哌嗪、环己胺、2-甲基吡啶、N,N-二甲基苄基胺、N,N-二乙基乙醇胺、二环己胺、N,N-二甲基乙醇胺、胆碱、N,N’-二甲基哌嗪、1,4-二氮杂双环(2,2,2)辛烷、N-甲基二乙醇胺、N-甲基乙醇胺、N-甲基哌啶、3-甲基哌啶、N-甲基环己胺、3-甲基吡啶、4-甲基吡啶、奎宁环、N,N’-二甲基-1,4-二氮杂双环-(2,2,2)辛烷离子、二正丁胺、新戊胺、二正戊胺、异丙胺、叔丁胺、乙二胺、吡咯烷、2-咪唑啉酮、二异丙基乙胺、二甲基环己胺、环戊胺、N-甲基-正丁胺、六亚甲基亚胺等伯胺、仲胺、叔胺、多胺。\n其中，从反应性的方面考虑，优选吗啉、三乙胺、环己胺、异丙胺、二异丙基乙胺、N-甲基正丁胺、四乙基氢氧化铵，工业上更优选更廉价的吗啉、三乙胺、环己胺。它们可以单独使用1种，也可以混合使用2种以上。\n在通过水热合成来制造本发明的硅铝酸盐沸石的情况下，作为原料的水性凝胶(原料混合物)通常通过将铝源、硅源、根据需要使用的Fe等Me源、碱金属或碱土金属以及模板剂进行混合来制备。\n作为铝源、硅源、Me源，可以使用与合成上述磷铝酸盐时同样的原料(原料化合物)。但是，在合成硅铝酸盐沸石的情况下，作为铝源，优选使用含有结晶性氢氧化铝、结晶性氧基氢氧化铝或结晶性氧化铝(下文中称为“结晶性铝源”)的铝源。作为结晶性氢氧化铝，可以举出三水铝石、三羟铝石、诺三水铝石、三斜三水铝石(doylite)等。作为结晶性氧基氢氧化铝，可以举出勃姆石(γ-AlOOH)、一水硬铝石(α-AlOOH)等。作为结晶性氧化铝，可以举出α-Al2O3(刚玉)、χ-Al2O3、δ-Al2O3、γ-Al2O3、η-Al2O3、κ-Al2O3、θ-Al2O3等。其中，优选含有结晶性氢氧化铝或结晶性氧基氢氧化铝的结晶性铝源，进一步优选含有三水铝石、三羟铝石或勃姆石的结晶性铝源，特别优选含有三水铝石、三羟铝石的结晶性铝源。\n在使用结晶性铝源作为原料化合物的情况下，能够加快沸石的结晶化。其理由尚不明确，推测如下。非结晶性的铝源、换言之为非晶的铝源的反应性高，因此，水性凝胶、特别是在水性凝胶中补充有籽晶的沸石前体凝胶在达到沸石结晶温度之前与硅源反应，生成反应性差的二氧化硅-氧化铝化合物。另一方面，结晶性铝源的反应性低，因此，沸石前体凝胶在达到沸石结晶温度后才开始与硅源反应，快速地生成沸石。\n作为用作硅铝酸盐沸石的原料(原料化合物)的模板剂，通常使用胺类、季铵盐类。例如，在合成CHA型硅铝酸盐的情况下，可以举出美国专利第4544538号说明书、美国专利公开第2008/0075656号说明书中记载的有机模板剂作为优选的模板剂。具体而言，例如可以举出由1-金刚烷胺衍生的阳离子、由3-喹宁醇衍生的阳离子、由3-外型-氨基降冰片烯衍生的阳离子等由脂环式胺衍生的阳离子。其中，更优选由1-金刚烷胺衍生的阳离子。在由1-金刚烷胺衍生的阳离子之中，更优选N,N,N-三烷基-1-金刚烷铵阳离子。N,N,N-三烷基-1-金刚烷铵阳离子的3个烷基通常为各自独立的烷基，优选为低级烷基，更优选为甲基。其中，最优选的化合物为N,N,N-三甲基-1-金刚烷铵阳离子。\n作为用作原料化合物的碱金属、碱土金属，可以使用有机模板剂的抗衡阴离子的氢氧根离子、NaOH、KOH等碱金属氢氧化物、Ca(OH)2等碱土金属氢氧化物等。碱金属、碱土金属的种类没有特别限定，通常为Na、K、Li、Rb、Cs、Ca、Mg、Sr、Ba，优选为Na、K。另外，碱金属、碱土金属也可以合用两种以上。\n<籽晶>\n本发明中，使用籽晶作为“沸石“制造原料(原料化合物)的一种成分。\n本发明中使用的籽晶优选与要制造的“沸石”具有同等组成、沸石结构。籽晶的结晶性没有特别限定，可以含有非晶成分。另外，除去模板剂之前或除去模板剂之后的“沸石”均可以作为籽晶使用。\n因此，籽晶优选由与“沸石”的制造中使用的沸石前体凝胶具有相同配合的沸石前体凝胶、或者除了不含籽晶以外与“沸石”的制造中使用的沸石前体凝胶具有相同配合的水性凝胶来制造。该籽晶在水热合成中有时会部分溶解而无法看到，但并不是完全以原子水平分散，而是以微小的块的形式存在，成为沸石结晶生长时的起点等，对“沸石”的生长、粒度分布的改善显示出效果，该籽晶不仅具有这样的现有公知的效果，而且在像本发明这样在短时间内制造时，还能够抑制急剧的结晶生长所带来的水性凝胶压力的变动，能够得到提高水性凝胶供给的稳定性、减小管型反应器的厚度从而改善热效率等效果。\n作为籽晶的沸石的制造方法没有特别限定，可以利用本发明的“沸石”的制造方法来制造，也可以利用其他方法、例如使用高压釜等以一般的间歇方式来制造。\n籽晶的粒径过大时，在上述本发明中使用的管型反应器中，可能阻碍沸石前体凝胶的流通，另一方面，过小时，可能无法充分发挥作为籽晶的效果，因此，籽晶的粒径以平均粒径计优选为0.01μm以上，更优选为0.1μm以上，作为上限，优选为100μm以下，特别优选为50μm以下。因此，在所制造的籽晶的粒径过大的情况下，优选适当进行粉碎等粒度调节。作为粉碎的方法，可以举出使用球磨机、珠磨机、行星式球磨机、喷磨机等的方法。其中，珠磨机能够将沸石的非晶化抑制在最低限度，能够高效地进行粉碎，因而优选。珠磨机是通常使用粒径为50～500μm的陶瓷珠来进行破碎、粉碎的装置。\n关于籽晶的平均粒径，从扫描型电子显微镜照片中随机选取数十个颗粒，利用图像分析软件求出各颗粒的截面积，利用下式计算出各颗粒的粒径，对所得到的粒径的值进行算术平均，作为平均粒径。\n[数1]\n\n\n\n籽晶的添加量过少时，无法充分得到籽晶的添加效果，过多时，籽晶相对于所制造的“沸石”的比例多，在生产效率方面不优选。因此，籽晶相对于磷铝酸盐沸石的制造中使用的水性凝胶中的铝源的Al2O3换算量优选为0.1重量％以上，特别优选为1重量％以上。另一方面，作为上限，优选添加20重量％、特别优选为15重量％以下的量。另外，籽晶相对于硅铝酸盐沸石的制造中使用的水性凝胶中的硅源的SiO2换算量优选为0.1重量％以上，特别优选为1重量％以上。另一方面，作为上限，优选为20重量％以下，特别优选添加15重量％以下的量。\n<水性凝胶的制备(原料化合物的混合)>\n在制备磷铝酸盐合成用的水性凝胶(原料混合物)时，上述铝源、磷源、籽晶、根据需要使用的Me源、模板剂以及水的混合顺序根据条件而不同，通常，首先将磷源、铝源与水混合，在其中混合Me源和模板剂，根据需要进行后述的熟化。最后，在该水性凝胶(原料混合物)中添加籽晶，制成沸石前体凝胶(将两种以上原料化合物混合而成的物质称为“原料混合物”。在本说明书中，将用于制造“沸石”所需要的所有原料化合物以必要量混合而成的物质为“沸石前体凝胶”)。\n水性凝胶(原料混合物)的组成中，以氧化物的摩尔比表示，P2O5/Al2O3通常为0.6以上，进而从合成的容易性的方面出发，优选为0.7以上，更优选为0.8以上。另外，以氧化物的摩尔比表示，P2O5/Al2O3通常为1.7以下，优选为1.6以下，更优选为1.5以下。另外，在使用Me源的情况下，MeOx(x在Me为2价的情况下为1、在Me为3价的情况下为1.5)/P2O5通常为0.01以上，为1.5以下，进而从合成的容易性的方面出发，优选为0.02以上，更优选为0.05以上。MeOx/P2O5通常为1.5以下，从合成的容易性的方面出发，优选为1.0以下，更优选为0.8以下。另外，在使用模板剂的情况下，模板剂以相对于Al2O3的摩尔比计优选以0.2以上、特别优选0.5以上且4以下、特别是3以下进行混合。模板剂的用量过少时，难以发生结晶化，另外，水热耐久性不充分，过多时，“沸石”的收率降低。另外，作为水的比例的下限，相对于Al2O3，以摩尔比计为3以上，从合成的容易性的方面出发，优选为5以上，更优选为10以上。作为水的比例的上限，为200以下，从合成的容易性、生产率高度的方面出发，优选为150以下，更优选为120以下。\n需要说明的是，在水性凝胶(原料混合物)中，可以根据期望共存上述以外的成分。作为这样的成分，可以举出碱金属、碱土金属的氢氧化物或盐、醇等亲水性有机溶剂。需要说明的是，以上的记载对于“沸石前体凝胶”也同样。\n在制备硅铝酸盐用的水性凝胶时，上述铝源、硅源、籽晶、根据需要使用的Fe等Me源、碱金属或碱土金属、模板剂以及水的混合顺序根据条件而不同，通常，首先将Me源、铝源、碱金属或碱土金属以及水混合，向其中混合硅源、模板剂，根据需要进行后述的熟化。最后，在该水性凝胶(原料混合物)中添加籽晶，制成最终原料混合物(沸石前体凝胶)。\n水性凝胶的组成中，以氧化物的摩尔比表示，SiO2/Al2O3通常为4以上，进而从合成的容易性的方面出发，优选为5以上，更优选为10以上，特别优选为15以上。水性凝胶的组成中，以氧化物的摩尔比表示，SiO2/Al2O3由于可以全部为Si因而上限没有特别限定，但优选为2000以下，更优选为1000以下，特别优选为500以下。另外，在使用Me源的情况下，MeOx(x在Me为2价的情况下为1、在Me为3价的情况下为1.5)/SiO2通常为0.0001以上，进而从合成的容易性的方面出发，优选为0.0002以上，更优选为0.0005以上。MeOx/SiO2通常为0.1以下，进而从合成的容易性的方面出发，优选为0.05以下，更优选为0.02以下。另外，在使用模板剂的情况下，模板剂以相对于SiO2的摩尔比计优选以0.02以上、特别优选0.1以上且1以下、特别是0.5以下的方式进行混合。模板剂的用量过少时，难以发生结晶化，另外，水热耐久性不充分，过多时，“沸石”的收率降低。另外，作为水的比例的下限，相对于SiO2，以摩尔比计为3以上，从合成的容易性的方面出发，优选为5以上，更优选为10以上。作为水的比例的上限，相对于SiO2，以摩尔比计为200以下，从合成的容易性、生产率高度的方面出发，优选为150以下，更优选为120以下。\n<熟化>\n“熟化”是指将原料混合物在不会新生成结晶的温度下保持规定时间。通过熟化，能够促进水热合成中的原料化合物的溶解、结晶核的生成等，能够进一步缩短水热合成时间。\n熟化温度只要为沸石、磷酸盐、铝化合物、硅化合物等不发生结晶化的温度范围，则没有特别限定，通常为室温以上，优选为50℃以上，进一步优选为70℃以上，并且通常为150℃以下，优选为120℃以下，进一步优选为100℃以下。温度过低时，无法显现熟化的效果，另外，温度过高时，沸石等开始结晶化。需要说明的是，在此，室温通常为10～40℃的范围。\n熟化时间至少为2小时以上，通常为6小时以上，优选为12小时以上，进一步优选为24小时以上。在此，熟化时间从将原料化合物和原料混合物混合而得到作为熟化对象的原料混合物的组成的时刻起算。另外，在将其他的原料化合物或原料混合物加入到该作为熟化对象的原料混合物中的时刻、或者将该作为熟化对象的原料混合物供于水热合成的时刻结束熟化。熟化时间过短时，无法显现熟化的效果。熟化时间不存在特别的上限，通常为120小时以下，优选为96小时以下。\n<“沸石”作为催化剂的利用>\n利用本发明的制造方法得到的“沸石”可以用作通过与乙烯和/或乙醇接触而能够制造丙烯的催化剂。\n<“沸石”的甲硅烷基化>\n在将本发明中得到的“沸石”作为丙烯制造用催化剂使用的情况下，可以对“沸石”的外表面进行甲硅烷基化。甲硅烷基化的方法特别没有限定，例如可以使用国际公开2010/128644号小册子中记载的方法。\n通过甲硅烷基化得到的“沸石”的外表面酸量没有特别限定，但是通常优选为结晶所含有的总酸量的5％以下。\n外表面酸量为在“沸石”外表面上存在的酸点的量，结晶所含有的总酸量为在结晶的微孔内存在的酸点的量与外表面酸点的量的总和。本发明中的这些值利用国际公开2010/128644号小册子中记载的方法进行测定。\n外表面酸点过多时，在将该“沸石”作为后述的丙烯制造用催化剂使用的情况下，在催化剂的外表面发生非形状选择性的反应，有引起副产物增多的倾向，因此外表面酸量越少越好。\n<成形处理>\n在将本发明中得到的”沸石”作为催化剂用于反应的情况下，可以直接使用，也可以使用已知的对反应呈惰性的物质、粘结剂利用已知的方法进行造粒、成形，或者将它们混合后用于反应。另外，还可以通过成形使“沸石”的外表面酸量相对于全体酸量降低至优选的比例，从而提高丙烯选择性。\n作为上述对反应呈惰性的物质、粘结剂，可以举出氧化铝或氧化铝溶胶、二氧化硅、硅溶胶、石英及它们的混合物等。作为通过成形来降低外表面酸量的方法，例如可以举出使粘结剂与“沸石”外表面的酸点结合等方法。\n<丙烯的制造方法>\n使用通过本发明的制造方法得到的“沸石”作为催化剂的丙烯的制造可以利用已知的方法进行。具体而言，可以使用日本特开2007-291076号公报、国际公开2010/128644号小册子中记载的方法。\n<含过渡金属沸石作为氮氧化物净化用催化剂的利用>\n利用本发明的制造方法得到的“沸石”通过含有过渡金属，能够作为氮氧化物净化用催化剂来利用。\n包含在本发明中得到的“沸石”中含有过渡金属而得到的含过渡金属沸石的催化剂作为与含有氮氧化物的废气接触从而对氮氧化物进行净化的催化剂是有效的。在该废气中可以含有氮氧化物以外的成分，例如可以含有烃、一氧化碳、二氧化碳、氢气、氮气、氧气、硫氧化物、水。另外，可以组合使用烃、氨、脲等含氮化合物等公知的还原剂。具体而言，利用本发明的氮氧化物净化用催化剂，能够对由柴油汽车、汽油汽车、固定式发电、船舶、农业机械、建设机械、二轮车、飞机用的各种柴油发动机、锅炉、燃气涡轮等排出的多种多样的废气中含有的氮氧化物进行净化。\n<过渡金属>\n本发明中使用的过渡金属只要是负载在沸石上而具有催化剂活性的金属就没有特别限定，优选选自铁、钴、钯、铱、铂、铜、银、金、铈、镧、镨、钛、锆等的组。进一步优选为铁或铜。另外，负载在沸石上的过渡金属也可以组合负载有2种以上的过渡金属。\n<含过渡金属沸石>\n关于含过渡金属沸石，有通过在水热合成时由含有过渡金属的凝胶进行合成来得到的方法、以及在煅烧后的沸石上负载过渡金属的方法。在煅烧后的沸石上负载过渡金属的情况下，可以使用通常所用的离子交换法、浸渍负载法、沉淀负载法、固相离子交换法、CVD法等。优选为离子交换法、浸渍负载法。在干燥后，通常在400℃至900℃进行热处理。关于热处理，为了提高金属的分散、提高与沸石表面的相互作用，优选在700℃以上进行热处理。热处理的气氛没有特别限定，可以在大气下、氮气下、氩气下等非活性气氛下进行，也可以含有水蒸气。\n[实施例]\n以下使用实施例更具体地说明本发明，但本发明只要不超出其要点，则不限定于以下实施例。\n[合成例1：籽晶的合成]\n将85重量％磷酸、纯水以及假勃姆石(Catapal

Projects Agency–Energy)授予的项目号DE-AR0000178完成。政府对本发明具有一定的权利。\n\n技术背景\n电动车依赖于电化学能量存储(通常为锂离子电池)进行推进而不是车载燃烧的液体或气体燃料。主要由于锂离子电池的高成本和有限行驶里程，电动车(EV)仍代表小部分运输行业。在降低成本和提高电化学存储的能量密度方面已做出大量的研究努力。或者，如果降低对电池的能量需求，那么通过同样的电池可获得延长的行驶里程。\n据估计在EV运行期间消耗的多达40％车载能量可能被消耗用于在极端气候中加热和冷却汽车车厢。用于气候调节车辆车厢的改进(例如，较低能源成本)的加热和冷却系统提供降低对供能车辆的锂离子电池的能量需求的可能性。这样，可增加EV的行驶里程。\n能源相关申请诸如热能和电化学存储和交换极大地影响了全球经济和环境并且已成为积极研究和开发的领域。在热能和电化学申请中，热能和电化学装置(例如，EV)的性能可通过掺入有效的导热性和导电性材料来极大地提高。具体地说，石墨材料已在热能和电化学申请二者中用作传统导电材料诸如金属的可行性替代方案。石墨材料通常为重量轻的、稳定的、与许多不同类型热能和电化学活性材料相容的且成本有效的。然而，连续而有高质量石墨含量的石墨材料难以获得。\n多孔金属材料存在广谱的高级应用可能性。在金属泡沫的情况下，应用包括过滤器、电池和燃料电池电极、热交换器、催化剂和重量轻的结构材料。多孔金属材料的优点大体上涉及高孔隙率、高表面积和轻重量。对于许多应用，希望的是孔隙率尽可能高。对于许多应用，另一种希望的特征为多孔金属内的孔体积为高度互连或开放的。这对于金属过滤器、电极材料、热交换器和催化剂而言尤其如此。\n自1991年发现碳纳米管以来已对其进行了深入的研究。发现单一薄壁或多壁形式的纳米管具有广泛的直径和长度范围。这些碳材料具有许多不同寻常且有价值的特征，诸如高度各向异性(即，定向型)导热性。需要新的碳材料及其制备方法以及利用它们的方法和装置(例如，蓄热单元)。\n潜热储存为大量技术中的重要考虑因素。潜热为在材料状态改变而材料温度未大量改变期间释放或吸收的热能。状态改变可包括相变，诸如固体至液体、固体至气体、液体至气体或固体至固体相变，诸如结晶固体至无定形固相改变。\n相变材料(PCM)为具有高潜热且在所希望的温度下发生相变的组合物。例如，当PCM冷冻时，从液体变成固体，它会释放大量熔化潜热形式的热量。当材料熔化时，随着它从固体变成液体会从环境中吸收等量的能量。同样地，当PCM从气体冷凝成液体时，它释放大量蒸发潜热形式的能量，在它沸腾而从液体变成气体时从环境中吸收等量的能量。\n目前有许多不同类型的PCM可用；然而，其各自具有使其适用于一种用途而不适用于另一种用途的相关优点和缺点。这样，开发新的PCM为正在进行的研究目的并且需要新的PCM，也需要PCM的新应用。\n概述\n在一方面，正如本文中体现和广泛描述的，根据所公开的材料、化合物、组合物、物品、装置和方法的目的，所公开的主题涉及组合物和用于制备并使用所公开组合物的方法。在特定方面，所公开的主题大体上涉及包含可用作PCM的糖醇共混物的组合物。所公开的糖醇共混物含有一定比率的半乳糖醇和甘露糖醇，以提供高熔化热和相对低的熔点。所公开的组合物可任选地包含粘度增强剂、添加剂和导热性调节剂。在其他方面，还公开了包含所公开组合物和导热性调节剂的热复合物和含有这些复合物的装置。\n本文还公开了在碳衬底上形成碳纳米管的方法。还公开了具有碳纳米管的碳衬底，尤其是碳衬底上的碳纳米管共形层，还公开制备和使用这些材料的方法。\n本文还公开了具有赋予特定热特性和电特性的结构的三维石墨基质。在一些实施方案中，三维(3D)印刷技术与化学气相沉积或高温热解技术结合，以产生这些3D石墨基质。\n本文还提供蓄热单元。蓄热单元可包括热交换介质流过其中的热交换路径和与热交换路径热接触的蓄热介质。蓄热介质可包括由多孔导热性基质和设置于多孔导热性基质内的相变材料形成的复合物。导热性基质可包括金属泡沫、含碳或含石墨金属泡沫、石墨泡沫、碳泡沫、3D印刷石墨基质或其组合。本文所述的蓄热单元可用于其中需要存蓄热能的任何应用。作为实例，本文所述的蓄热单元可结合到车辆(诸如电动车)的HVAC系统中。\n所公开主题的其他优点将部分在随后的描述中阐述，并且部分根据描述将是显而易见的，或可通过实践下述方面而了解。以下所描述的优点将借助在所附权利要求书中具体指出的要素和组合来实现和达到。应理解，前面的概述和下面的详述都仅仅是示例性和说明性的而不是限制性的。\n\n\n附图描述\n图1为示例性多孔石墨基质单元的示意图。\n图2A为通过堆叠具有偏置径向薄壁的两个基质单元来产生石墨基质的示例性方法的示意图。\n图2B为示出图2A的石墨基质的横截面视图的图表。\n图2C为具有插入所组装石墨基质中心开口内的管的基质的示意图。\n图3为示出并排对齐的石墨基质的图表。\n图4A和图4B为蓄热单元的示意图。\n图5为蓄热单元的示意图。\n图6为用于EV的HVAC系统的示意图，EV包括两个蓄热单元。\n图7为用于EV的HVAC系统的示意图，EV包括两个蓄热单元。\n详述\n通过参考公开主题的特定方面的以下详细描述和其中包括的实施例，可以更容易地理解本文中描述的材料、化合物、组合物、物品和方法。\n在公开和描述本发明的材料、化合物、组合物和方法之前，应理解下述方面不限于特定的合成方法或特定的试剂，因此当然可以变化。还应理解，本文所使用的术语仅出于描述特定方面的目的，且并不意图加以限制。\n此外，贯穿本说明书参考了多种出版物。这些出版物的公开内容特此以引用的方式整体并入本申请以便更充分地描述所公开的主题涉及的领域的现状。对所公开的参考文献中包含并且在其引用的句子中讨论的材料还单独并具体地以引用的方式并入本文。\n一般定义\n在本说明书和随附权利要求书中，将会提及若干术语，这些术语应被定义为具有以下含义：\n如本文所用的术语“包含/包括(comprising)”及其变体(诸如“包含/包括(comprise)”和“包含/包括(comprises)”)与术语“包括/包含(including)”及其变体同义地使用并且均为开放的非限制性术语。尽管术语“包括/包含(comprising)”和“包括/包含(including)”已在本文中用于描述不同实施方案，但是术语“基本上由...组成(consisting essentially of)”和“由...组成(consisting of)”可用于代替“包含/包括(comprising)”和“包括/包含(including)”来提供更具体的本发明的实施方案并且也公开这些实施方案。\n除非上下文另外明确规定，否则在描述和随附的权利要求书中使用的单数形式“一个/种(a/an)”和“所述/该(the)”包括多个指示物。因此，例如，提及“一种组合物”包括两种或更多种这些组合物的混合物，提及“所述化合物”包括两种或更多种这些化合物的混合物，提及“一种试剂”包括两种或更多种这些药剂的混合物等。\n“任选的”或“任选地”是指后面描述的事项或情形可能发生，或者可能不发生，并且该描述包括该事项或情形发生的情况和不发生的情况。\n在本文中，范围可表达为从“约”一个具体值和/或到“约”另一个具体值。“约”一词意指在该值的5％内，例如该值的4％、3％、2％或1％内。当表示这样一个范围时，另一方面包括从一个具体值和/或至另一个具体值。类似地，当通过使用先行词“约”将值表达为近似值时，将理解的是特定值形成了另一方面。应进一步理解，该范围的每个端点相对于另一个端点以及独立于另一个端点都是有意义的。\n除非特意相反地陈述，否则组分的重量百分比(重量％)是基于其中包含组分的制剂或组合物的总重量。\n如本文所用的术语“石墨烯”和该单词的其他形式诸如“石墨”和“石墨的”意指六角形碳。如本文所公开的，石墨烯层被认为是基本上纯的。基本上纯的一词意指石墨烯层含有约1％或更少(例如，少于约0.5％、0.25％或0.1％)的碳以外的材料。另外，石墨烯层被认为是基本上不含无定形碳，这意味着石墨烯层具有小于约10％(例如，小于约7％、5％、2.5％或1％)的无定形或非六角形构型的碳。石墨烯的纯度可使用不同技术测定，即通过相衬透射电子显微镜法、X射线衍射分析、拉曼光谱法、热解重量分析或其组合。\n如本文所用的术语“共形层”意指沉积于基本上所有的衬底表面上的基本上均匀的厚度。“基本上均匀的厚度”一词意指厚度变化小于10％。“基本上所有的衬底表面”意指超过90％的衬底表面积。\n现将详细参考公开的材料、化合物、组合物、物品和方法的特定方面，其实例在随附的实施例和附图中说明。\n具有高潜热的糖醇共混物\n高熔化潜热对于蓄热应用为希望的，因为它决定有效的热能密度。然而，熔化热通常与熔化温度成比例，并且从应用角度来看，较高熔化温度可能具有不希望的缺点，这些缺点取决于应用，例如需要更好地绝缘。公开的PCM组合物通过将两种高潜热材料(半乳糖醇和甘露醇)共混来保持高潜热，但是所得材料具有比两种纯材料更低的熔化温度。公开的PCM组合物液也具有高热稳定性且为不腐蚀的，这是基于脂肪酸的PCM的常见缺点。\n本文公开了两种糖醇半乳糖醇和甘露醇的共混物和包含这些共混物的PCM组合物。\n\n\n\n半乳糖醇具有357J/g的熔化潜热和187℃的熔点。甘露醇具有308J/g的熔化潜热和162℃的熔点。已发现这两种糖醇的某些共混物维持高熔化潜热和低熔点(低于纯组分)，使共混物成为PCM和介质温度蓄热应用的适合组合。\n半乳糖醇和甘露醇可以约9:1至约1:9的重量比存在于所公开的共混物中。例如，半乳糖醇与甘露醇的重量比可为约9:1、约8.5:1、约8:1、约7.5:1、约7:1、约6.5:1、约6:1、约5.5:1、约5:1、约4.5:1、约4:1、约3.5:1、约3:1、约2.5:1、约2:1、约1.5:1、约1:1、约1:1.5、约1:2、约1:2.5、约1:3、约1:3.5、约1:4、约1:4.5、约1:5、约1:5.5、约1:6、约1:6.5、约1:7、约1:7.5、约1:8、约1:8.5或约1:9，其中任何比率可形成比率范围的上端点或下端点。在其他实例中，半乳糖醇与甘露醇的重量比为约2.5:1至约1:1.5。例如，半乳糖醇与甘露醇的重量比可为约2.5:1、约2:1、约1.5:1、约1:1以及约1:1.5，其中任何比率可形成比率范围的上端点或下端点。在另一个优选的实例中，半乳糖醇与甘露醇的重量比可为约2:1至约1:1。在一个最优选的实例中，半乳糖醇与甘露醇的重量比为约1:1。\n半乳糖醇和甘露醇共混物为所公开PCM组合物的主要组分。例如，半乳糖醇和甘露醇共混物的量可为总组合物的至少约75重量％。在其他实例中，半乳糖醇和甘露醇共混物的量可为总组合物的至少约75重量％、约80重量％、约85重量％、约90重量％、约95重量％、约98重量％或约99重量％，其中任何所述值可形成范围的上端点或下端点。\n所公开的共混物和包含它们的组合物的熔点可为约150℃至约160℃，例如约150℃、约151℃、约152℃、约153℃、约154℃、约155℃、约156℃、约157℃、约158℃、约159℃或约160℃，其中任何所述值可形成范围的上端点或下端点。在一个优选的实例中，所公开的共混物和含有它们的组合物的熔点可为约151℃至约153℃。\n所公开的共混物和包含它们的组合物的熔化潜热可为约280至约315J/g，例如约280、约285、约290、约295、约300、约305、约310以及约315J/g，其中任何所述值可形成范围的上端点或下端点。在一个优选的实例中，所公开的共混物和含有它们的组合物的熔化潜热可为约300至约310J/g。\n共混物和包含它们的组合物的熔融焓可为约100至约700MJ/m3。例如，熔融焓可为约100MJ/m3、约150MJ/m3、约200MJ/m3、约250MJ/m3、约300MJ/m3、约350MJ/m3、约400MJ/m3、约450MJ/m3、约500MJ/m3、约550MJ/m3、约600MJ/m3、约650MJ/m3或约700MJ/m3，其中任何所述值可形成范围的上端点或下端点。\n在一个优选的实例中，所公开的共混物和包含它们的组合物可包含重量比为约1:1的半乳糖醇和甘露醇，它具有约151℃至约153℃的熔点和约300J/g至约310J/g的熔化潜热。\n本文还涵盖的是两种糖醇中的一种或两种可被化学修饰来调整熔化潜热和熔点并因此调整共混物的熔化潜热和熔点。例如，半乳糖醇和/或甘露醇可在一个或多个位置被氧化或还原。可选地或另外地，半乳糖醇和/或甘露醇可在一个或多个位置被烷基、氨基、酰氨基、氰基、硫代基或酯基官能化。半乳糖醇和/或甘露醇还可被转化成吡喃糖或呋喃糖形式。\n通过修饰半乳糖醇和/或甘露醇可降低共混物的熔点。因此，在此情况下，共混物的熔点可为约120℃至约160℃，例如约120℃、约121℃、约122℃、约123℃、约124℃、约125℃、约126℃、约127℃、约128℃、约129℃、约130℃、约131℃、约132℃、约133℃、约134℃、约135℃、约136℃、约137℃、约138℃、约139℃、约140℃、约141℃、约142℃、约143℃、约144℃、约145℃、约146℃、约147℃、约148℃、约149℃、约150℃、约151℃、约152℃、约153℃、约154℃、约155℃、约156℃、约157℃、约158℃、约159℃或约160℃，其中任何所述值可形成范围的上端点或下端点。在一个优选的实例中，所公开的组合物的熔点可为约120℃至约150℃、约130℃至约150℃或约140℃至约150℃。\n所公开的组合物可任选地包含一种或多种粘度调节剂。例如，在所公开的组合物中的粘度调节剂可为甘油、赤藓糖醇、苏糖醇、阿糖醇、木糖醇、核糖醇、山梨醇、卫矛醇、艾杜糖醇、异麦芽糖醇、麦芽糖醇或乳糖醇。在其他实例中，在所公开的组合物中适合的粘度调节剂可为二异氰酸酯，诸如二苯甲烷二异氰酸酯(MDI)、甲苯二异氰酸酯(TDI)、亚萘基二异氰酸酯(NDI)、异佛尔酮二异氰酸酯(IPDI)和/或六亚甲基二异氰酸酯(HDI)。\n所公开的组合物可任选地包含一种或多种添加剂。在所公开的组合物中可包含的一种类型的添加剂为抗微生物剂。因为所公开的组合物含有糖醇，所以在某些情况下微生物生长可能是一个问题。因此，可使用任何可预防或减少所公开组合物中的微生物生长的抗微生物材料。适合抗微生物材料的实例包括金属，诸如铜、锌或银和/或其盐。适合的抗微生物材料的其他实例包括天然和合成的有机组合物，诸如β-内酰胺抗生素(如盘尼西林或头孢菌素)和蛋白质合成抑制剂(如新霉素)。还可使用诸如乳酸、乙酸或柠檬酸的抗微生物材料。在一些其他实例中，抗微生物材料可包括季胺化合物，诸如苯扎氯铵、苄索氯铵、甲苄索氯铵、西他氯铵、西吡氯铵、十六烷基三甲铵、西曲溴铵、多法氯铵(dofanium

Graphite,Inc.,Decatur,TX)。\n在某些实施方案中，导热性基质可包括3D印刷石墨基质。3D印刷石墨基质为使用3-D印刷模板形成的石墨材料。3D印刷可提供对石墨材料形态的精确控制。因此，3D印刷基质可具有一个结构，结构包括由连续石墨材料形成的微孔网络。\n3D印刷石墨基质可被形成为具有任何适合的形态。用于制备3D印刷石墨基质的方法可包括使用3D印刷方法形成微孔模板并使微孔模板石墨化，以产生3D印刷石墨基质。微孔模板可由任何适合的可石墨化材料形成，材料可使用标准3-D印刷方法印刷。例如，微孔模板可为金属模板(例如，镍模板)或可石墨化聚合物模板。金属(例如Ni)模板可通过直接金属激光烧结(DMLS)金属(例如Ni)粉末来形成。DMLS使用小直径激光烧结金属粉末，以形成冶金键。激光路径为可控的并且通过持续添加更多层的金属粉末，微孔金属模板可基于数字模型来印刷。各种各样的3D印刷方法(包括立体平版印刷和选择性激光烧结)可用于形成微孔聚合物模板。模板的结构可单独地被设计用于特定应用，即合理地设计。例如，3D石墨基质可被设计为具有与用于热传递的所需路径相对应的结构。\n一旦使用3-D印刷方法形成，就可使微孔模板石墨化。用于使基质石墨化的方法可根据多种因素而改变，因素包括微孔模板的组成。金属模板(例如，Ni模板)可使用睾丸化学气相沉积(CVD)来进行石墨化，以在金属模板表面上形成石墨基质。一旦形成石墨基质，金属模板可被蚀刻掉，如上所述的。由可石墨化聚合物形成的模板可通过热解可石墨化聚合物来进行石墨化。此过程可由微孔模板直接形成3D石墨基质。聚合物模板也可通过使聚合物模板金属化并且然后使用以上所述用于使金属模板石墨化的方法使所金属化聚合物模板石墨化。\n在一个优选的方面，导热性调节为包含多孔碳衬底上的碳纳米管共形层的杂化材料，如本文以下更充分描述的。\n碳衬底可选自由以下组成的组：碳泡沫、石墨泡沫和3D印刷石墨泡沫。碳衬底内石墨烯壁厚度可根据某些参数在合成中调整的方式来改变。例如，通过使用具有较厚支柱壁的镍泡沫、增加气相沉积时间以及增加碳前体浓度可增加碳衬底的石墨烯壁的厚度。通常，碳衬底壁的厚度可为约2nm至约500nm，例如约2、约50nm、约100nm、约150nm、约200nm、约250nm、约300nm、约350nm、约400nm、约450nm或约500nm，其中任何所述值可形成范围的上端点或下端点。\n碳纳米管在碳衬底上形成“森林状物”并且长度可为约1至约500μm。在碳衬底上的碳纳米管的直径可为约1至约50nm。在一些实例中，碳纳米管可包括单壁纳米管、双壁纳米管、多壁纳米管或其组合。\n碳纳米管可通过本文以下更充分描述的任何方法形成在碳衬底上。\n所公开的PCM和包含它们的热复合物适用于介质温度范围应用。例如，所公开的组合物和复合物可用于反应器或热能存储装置的热控制器中。\n本文所涵盖的一种特定装置为热电池。电动车(EV)常常忍受低效的加热和冷却系统，这些系统可通过充当对电池的消耗而限制其行驶里程。基于可充电式热能存储的冷的热电池可向EV提供有效加热和冷却而不会消耗车载电池组，从而有效地延长EV行驶里程。所公开的PCM组合物可用于高能量密度和低成本的蓄热系统，这可为EV提供有效的车厢加热和冷却。这些热电池也可结合到建筑物的加热和冷却系统中，从而增强能量效率并减少热能散发。\n在一些实例中，蓄热单元可包括壳管式热交换器，如本文以下更充分描述的。\n碳泡沫/碳纳米管杂化材料\n本文还公开了在碳衬底上形成碳纳米管的方法。该方法包括以下步骤：通过原子层沉积将缓冲层沉积在碳衬底上、将催化剂沉积在碳衬底和/或缓冲层上以及在高温(即足以引起工作气体分解的温度)下将衬底与工作气体接触，从而在碳衬底上形成碳纳米管。\n碳衬底可选自由以下组成的组：碳泡沫、石墨泡沫和3D印刷石墨泡沫。优选地，碳衬底为高度多孔的，正如碳和石墨泡沫一样。碳和石墨泡沫可通过在开孔网状镍泡沫上使用甲烷化学气相沉积(CVD)来合成。可使用多种化学气相装置。化学气相沉积装置通常包括装备有用于将衬底安装于其上的感受器的水平管状反应器、用于加热衬底的加热器、安排成使得管状反应器内供应的供料气体的方向平行于衬底的原料气体引入部分以及反应气体排出部分。因此，衬底放置于管状反应器内的感受器上，加热衬底，并且将含有进料气体的气体在平行于衬底以使得化学气相沉积在衬底上形成薄膜的方向上供应到反应器中。参见美国专利6,926,920、美国公开号2002-0160112，这些专利作为CVD技术的教导以引用的方式并入本文。\n进料气体为碳前体，例如二甲苯、甲苯、苯、甲烷、乙烷等。也可使用运载气体诸如氢气和氩气的混合物。\n在镍泡沫上形成石墨后，去除Ni。在一些实例中，可使用湿蚀刻剂去除Ni。适合的湿蚀刻剂的实例包括稀盐酸、氯化铁(III)、硝酸铁(III)、过硫酸铵以及硼酸。在一些实例中，可使用电解侵蚀去除Ni。例如，镍/石墨泡沫连接到阳极并且镍箔连接至DC电源的阴极，二者均浸渍在电解质中并且施加DC电压一从泡沫中去除镍。适合的电解质溶液的实例包括酸、镍盐和表面活性剂的混合物。适合的酸的实例包括硼酸、盐酸、硝酸以及硫酸。适合的镍盐的实例包括硫酸镍、硝酸镍、氯化镍以及其组合。适合的表面活性剂的实例包括十二烷基钠、十六烷基马洛芬氯、八乙二醇以及其组合。DC电压的范围可为约1至约8V，例如约1V、约2V、约3V、约4V、约5V、约6V、约7V或约8V，其中任何所述值可形成范围的上端点或下端点。DC电压可施加约1至约60分钟，例如，至少约1分钟、约5分钟、约10分钟、约15分钟、约20分钟、约25分钟、约30分钟、约35分钟、约40分钟、约45分钟、约50分钟、约55分钟或约60分钟，其中任何所述值可形成范围的上端点或下端点。\n碳纳米管“森林状物”在使用均匀缓冲层和/或催化层的碳衬底上生长。为获得均匀覆盖在碳衬底表面上的这个层，减轻由于遮蔽而产生的影响。通过使用物理气相沉积，例如电子束蒸发、热蒸发和溅射沉积而在平面衬底上制备催化层和缓冲层。这些方法由于对三维多孔结构有强遮蔽作用而不适合碳和石墨泡沫。基于溶液的方法避免遮蔽作用；然而，各层的覆盖和厚度的均匀性较差。\n本文公开了原子层沉积(ALD)沉积不同组合物的共形薄膜的用途。通过ALD获得在包括催化层和/或缓冲层的碳衬底上的均匀涂层，并且可获得整个碳衬底上的碳纳米管“森林状物”。\n原子层沉积为基于气相化学过程的连续使用的薄膜沉积技术。大部分ALD反应使用两种化学剂，通常称为前体。这些前体每次以连续的自限制方式与表面反应。通过将前体重复暴露于生长表面来沉积薄膜。\nALD为一种自限制(沉积于每个反应周期的薄膜材料的量为恒定的)连续表面化学过程，它将材料的共形薄膜沉积在不同组合物的衬底上。由于自限制和表面反应的特征，ALD薄膜生长使原子级沉积控制成为可能。ALD的化学过程与化学气相沉积类似，除了ALD反应将CVD反应分成两个半反应，在反应期间使前体材料保持分离。通过在整个涂层过程中将前体保持分离，薄膜生长的原子层控制可获得为每周期细到约前体的分离通过在每次前体脉冲后充入吹扫气体(诸如氮气或氩气)以从处理腔内去除过量前体并防止‘寄生性’CVD沉积于衬底上来实现。\n通过ALD生长材料层涉及重复以下特征性四个步骤：(1)将衬底与第一前体接触；(2)吹扫或抽空反应室以去除非反应性前体和气体反应副产物；(3)将衬底与第二前体–或另一种处理接触以再次活化表面，从而用于第一前体诸如等离子体的反应；(4)吹扫或抽空反应室。每个反应循环将给定量的材料添加到衬底表面，这称为每个循环的生长。为生长材料层，按所需薄膜厚度所需要地重复许多次反应循环。一个循环耗时约0.5秒至约几秒并且沉积约0.1至约的薄膜厚度。由于自终止反应，ALD为一种表面控制过程，其中除前体、衬底和温度之外的过程参数几乎不具有或不具有影响。并且由于表面控制，ALD生长薄膜的厚度非常共形且均匀。这些薄膜还可与其他常见制造方法结合来使用。\n使用ALD，薄膜厚度仅取决于反应循环数目，这使得厚度控制准确而简单。不太需要反应物流量的均匀性，该均匀性给予大面积(大批量且易于扩大的)性能、优异的正形性和再现性并且简化固态前体的使用。并且不同的多层结构的生长相当直接。ALD的其他优点为有广泛范围的薄膜材料可用、高密度和低杂质水平。而且，可使用较低沉积温度以便不影响敏感衬底。\n在所公开方法中，通过原子层沉积将缓冲层沉积于碳衬底上。根据催化剂是在缓冲层之前还是之后沉积，将催化剂沉积于碳衬底和/或缓冲层上。催化层可通过ALD或通过本文所述的其他沉积方法来沉积。然后，将具有缓冲层和催化层的衬底在足以引起工作气体分解的温度下与该气体接触，从而在碳衬底上形成碳纳米管。在一些实例中，可在催化剂沉积之前进行缓冲层的沉积。在其他实例中，可在缓冲层沉积之前沉积催化剂。\n可能需要在ALD沉积缓冲层之前等离子体处理碳衬底。在等离子体中，气体原子被激发至较高能量状态并被离子化。使用诸如氩气和氧气的气体以及诸如空气和氢气/氮气的混合物。等离子体处理可用于从表面去除杂质和污染物和/或改变表面疏水性，即将表面从疏水的改变成亲水的。在一些实例中，在原子层沉积之前将碳衬底氧等离子体处理约1至约5分钟。例如，将碳衬底氧等离子体处理至少约1分钟、约1.5分钟、约2分钟、约2.5分钟、约3分钟、约3.5分钟、约4分钟、约4.5分钟或约5分钟。\n当通过ALD应用缓冲层时，缓冲层可应用约1nm至约10nm厚度，例如约1nm、约2nm、约3nm、约4nm、约5nm、约6nm、约7nm、约8nm、约9nm或约10nm厚度，其中任何所述值可形成范围的上端点或下端点。可用作缓冲层的材料实例为铝、铱、金属氮化物或金属氧化物。金属氮化物的实例为氮化钛、氮化钽和氮化硅。金属氧化物的实例为氧化铝、氧化锌、氧化硅和氧化钛。在一个具体实例中，缓冲层可为约2nm至约10nm厚度，例如约1nm、约2nm、约3nm、约4nm、约5nm、约6nm、约7nm、约8nm、约9nm或约10nm厚度的氧化铝层，其中任何所述值可形成范围的上端点或下端点。在一个优选的实例中，缓冲层可为约5nm厚的氧化铝层。\n正如所述，催化剂可通过原子层沉积来沉积。在其他实例中，催化剂可使用化学气相沉积法来沉积。在其他实例中，催化剂可由气相金属源沉积。\n可沉积的适合催化剂的实例为铁、镍、钴、钼或其组合；镍/铬/铁合金；以及氧化铁/铜/镁组合。在一个优选的实例中，催化剂为铁催化剂。在优选的实例中，铁催化剂源于二茂铁。\n催化剂可沉积为碳衬底或缓冲上的一层。例如，催化剂可沉积为约2nm至约20nm厚度，例如约2nm、约3nm、约4nm、约5nm、约6nm、约7nm、约8nm、约9nm、约10nm、约11nm、约12nm、约13nm、约14nm、约15nm、约16nm、约17nm、约18nm、约19nm或约20nm厚度的一层，其中任何所述值可形成范围的上端点或下端点。\n或者，催化剂可沉积为碳衬底或缓冲上的颗粒。例如，催化剂可沉积为直径是约2nm至约20nm厚度，例如直径是约2nm、约3nm、约4nm、约5nm、约6nm、约7nm、约8nm、约9nm、约10nm、约11nm、约12nm、约13nm、约14nm、约15nm、约16nm、约17nm、约18nm、约19nm或约20nm的颗粒，其中任何所述值可形成范围的上端点或下端点。\n一旦缓冲剂和催化剂沉积在碳衬底上，衬底就接触工作气体，工作气体包含烃气。工作气体的适合实例为包含乙烯、乙炔、甲烷、甲苯、苯或其组合的气体。在一些实例中，工作气体以以下速率流过衬底：约1至约1000sccm，例如约1sccm、约50sccm、约100sccm、约150sccm、约200sccm、约250sccm、约300sccm、约350sccm、约400sccm、约450sccm、约500sccm、约550sccm、约600sccm、约650sccm、约70

Hull创造，3D印刷技术已应用于建筑学、建筑物(AEC)、工业设计、汽车、航空航天、军队、工程设计、土木工程、牙科医学产业、生物技术(人组织替换)、时装、鞋类、珠宝、眼镜、教育、地理信息系统、食品以及许多其他领域。聚合物和金属(例如金属合金，诸如含Ni合金)二者可使用多种技术印刷。\n本文公开了三维(3D)石墨基质。3D石墨基质的特征例如可在于高质量连续石墨材料，在一些实例中，材料可具有有效的热特性和电特性。石墨基质可通过3D印刷方法产生。例如，可使用3D印刷方法形成模板，随后将模板石墨化，以产生3D印刷石墨基质。3D印刷石墨基质为使用3D印刷模板形成的石墨材料。3D印刷可提供对于石墨材料形态的精确控制。因此，3D印刷基质可具有一个结构，结构包括由连续石墨材料形成的微孔网络。石墨材料可用于例如热交换器、蓄热装置(诸如热电池)、电化学存储和交换装置(诸如锂离子电池)等等。\n3D印刷石墨基质可被形成为具有任何适合的形态。用于制备3D印刷石墨基质的方法可包括使用3D印刷方法形成微孔模板并使微孔模板石墨化，以产生3D印刷石墨基质。微孔模板可由任何适合的可石墨化材料形成，材料可使用标准3-D印刷方法印刷。例如，微孔模板可为金属模板(例如，镍模板)或可石墨化聚合物模板。金属(例如Ni)模板可通过直接金属激光烧结(DMLS)金属(例如Ni)粉末来形成。DMLS使用小直径激光烧结金属粉末，以形成冶金键。激光路径为可控的并且通过持续添加更多层的金属粉末，微孔金属模板可基于数字模型来印刷。各种各样的3D印刷方法(包括立体平版印刷和选择性激光烧结)可用于形成微孔聚合物模板。模板的结构可单独地被设计用于特定应用，即合理地设计。例如，3D石墨基质可被设计为具有与用于热传递的所需路径相对应的结构。\n一旦使用3-D印刷方法形成，就可使微孔模板石墨化。用于使基质石墨化的方法可根据多种因素而改变，因素包括微孔模板的组成。金属模板(例如，Ni模板)可使用睾丸化学气相沉积(CVD)来进行石墨化，以在金属模板表面上形成石墨基质。一旦形成石墨基质，金属模板可被蚀刻掉，如上所述的。由可石墨化聚合物形成的模板可通过热解可石墨化聚合物来进行石墨化。此过程可由微孔模板直接形成3D石墨基质。聚合物模板也可通过使聚合物模板金属化并且然后使用以上所述用于使金属模板石墨化的方法使所金属化聚合物模板石墨化。\n在一些实施方案中，3D印刷石墨基质可如图1所示地制造。3D印刷石墨基质(500)可包括轮毂(502)、从轮毂(502)辐射的多个径向薄壁(504)以及同心地围绕轮毂(502)并与径向薄壁(504)相交以形成基质(520)(在基质内具有多个孔(508))的多个圆周薄壁(506)。3D印刷石墨基质(500)可具有顶部表面(510)和底部表面(512)。径向薄壁(504)和圆周薄壁(506)可基本上垂直于顶部表面(510)和底部表面(512)。孔(508)可开口于顶部表面(510)和底部表面(512)。轮毂(502)可包括从顶部表面(510)通过3D印刷石墨基质(500)的中心直到底部表面(512)的圆柱形开口(514)。轮毂(502)、圆周薄壁(506)和径向薄壁(504)可包含石墨碳。3D印刷石墨基质(500)可为等边六角形，其具有高度H、宽度W和长度L。\n在一些实施方案中，圆柱形开口(514)的半径范围可大于约0mm至约15mm(例如0-1mm、1-2mm、2-3mm、3-4mm、4-5mm、5-7mm、7-9mm、9-11mm、11-13mm、13-15mm或这些范围的任何组合)。在一些实施方案中，圆柱形开口(514)的半径可为约1.5mm至约6.5mm(例如1.5-2mm、2-2.5mm、2.5-3mm、3-3.5mm、3.5-4mm、4-4.5mm、4.5-5mm、5-5.5mm、5.5-6mm、6-6.5mm或这些范围的任何组合)。圆周薄壁(506)和径向薄壁(504)的厚度可为约0.01μm至约1μm(例如0.01-0.05μm、0.05-0.1μm、0.1-0.15μm、0.15-0.2μm、0.2-0.25μm、0.25-0.3μm、0.3-0.35μm、0.35-0.4μm、0.4-0.45μm、0.45-0.5μm、0.5-0.55μm、0.55-0.6μm、0.6-0.65μm、0.65-0.7μm、0.7-0.75μm、0.75-0.8μm、0.8-0.85μm、0.85-0.9μm、0.9-0.95μm、0.95-1μm或这些范围的任何组合)。在一些实施方案中，孔(508)可具有测量为孔的最大横截面尺寸的平均孔径，其为100μm至5000μm(例如100-200μm、200-300μm、300-400μm、400-500μm、500-750μm、750-1000μm、1000-1250μm、1250-1500μm、1500-1750μm、1750-2000μm、2000-2500μm、2500-3000μm、3000-3500μm、3500-4000μm、4000-4500μm、4500-5000μm或这些范围的任何组合)。3D印刷石墨基质的高度(H)可为0.2mm至100mm(例如0.2-1mm、1-5mm、5-10mm、10-20mm、20-30mm、30-40mm、40-50mm、50-75mm、75-1000mm或这些范围的任何组合)。3D印刷石墨基质的宽度、长度或直径可为5mm至500mm(例如5-10mm、10-20mm、20-40mm、40-60mm、60-100mm、100-150mm、150-200mm、200-250mm、250-300mm、300-350mm、350-400mm、400-450mm、450-500mm或这些范围的任何组合)。\n尽管图1中示出特定半径和圆周设计的图案，但可产生其他类似的特定微孔结构。在一些实施方案中，石墨基质可具有一个结构，其可包括第一多个薄壁和与第一多个薄壁相交以形成包括多个孔的基质的第二多个薄壁，其中结构包括石墨碳。\n在一些实施方案中，石墨基质不具有圆柱形开口。\n图2A展示将两个基质单元(500)和(500’)以其相应薄壁偏置(504对比504’，506对比506’)堆叠以产生石墨基质(550)的示例性方法的示意图。图2A示出单元(500)和(500’)与基质(550)的顶视图。多孔石墨基质单元(500)和(500’)二者可例如均为六边形并分别具有轮毂(502)和(502’)。在一些实施方案中，轮毂(502)和(502’)可具有相同尺寸。在一些实施方案中，轮毂(502)和(502’)可处于单元(500)和(500’)中相同的相对位置。在一些实例中，轮毂(502)和(502’)可分别具有圆柱形开口(514)和(514’)。在一些实施方案中，圆柱形开口(514)和(514’)可具有相同尺寸。在一些实施方案中，圆柱形开口(514)和(514’)可处于轮毂(502)和(502’)中相同的相对位置。在一些实施方案中，与单元(500’)的半径壁(504’)相对于轮毂(502’)的角度相比，单元(500)的半径壁(504)可以相对于轮毂(502)的不同角度辐射。在一些实施方案中，与单元(500’)的圆周壁(506’)位于距轮毂(502’)的距离相比，单元(500)的圆周壁(506)位于距轮毂(502)的不同距离处。在一些实施方案中，当单元(500)和(500’)堆叠在彼此顶部时，不同位置的壁(504)、(504’)、(506)和(506’)彼此偏置，同时单元(500)和(500’)的最外边缘和轮毂(502)和(502’)对齐，以形成整体式石墨基质(550)。图2B示出基质(550)沿着线B-B的横截面视图。在图2B中显示单元(500)堆叠在单元(500’)顶部并且显示圆柱形开口(514)和(514’)彼此对齐，其中圆周侧壁(506)和(506’)彼此偏置。尽管图2A和图2B仅示出两个单元垂直堆叠的单元，在一些实例中多个单元可垂直堆叠并对齐，以使得这些单元的圆柱形开口形成允许管通过的导管。参考图2C，将几个基质(550)堆叠在一起以形成多孔石墨基质(600)，其中单元(550)的圆柱形开口形成导管(602)。尽管在图2A-图2C中显示堆叠在一起的具有偏置薄壁的单元，在一些实施方案中，用于构建基质的单元并不必须具有偏置薄壁。例如，恰好具有相同的几组壁的单元可堆叠在一起以形成具有对齐的薄壁和对齐的孔的多孔基质。具有任何3D可印刷结构的单元可被使用并(在一些实例中)组合来形成石墨基质并且因此可产生具有许多结构图案的石墨基质。\n现参考图3，示出石墨基质束(610)的示意图。十九个基质(600)被排列为延长的六边形图案，以形成束(610)。石墨基质束(600)的导管(602)显示在该排列中彼此平行。\n在一些实例中，石墨基质可被碳纳米材料进一步修饰。例如，碳纳米管可形成在石墨基质上，以形成复合石墨基质。一种在石墨基质单元上形成碳纳米管的方法可包括通过原子层沉积将缓冲层沉积于石墨基质上；将催化剂沉积于石墨基质或缓冲层上；以及在高温下将石墨基质与工作气体接触，从而在石墨基质上形成碳纳米管，如本文以上更充分描述的。\n还公开了一种包含石墨基质和相变材料(PCM)的热复合物。PCM为具有高熔化热的物质，它在某一温度下熔化并凝固时能够存储并释放大量的热量。当材料从固体变成液体并相反时吸收或释放热量。例如，PCM可为水、盐水溶液、糖醇、石蜡、脂肪酸、水合盐、硝酸盐、氢氧化物、吸湿材料或其组合。更确切地说，PCM可为赤藓糖醇；木糖醇；甘露醇；半乳糖醇；半乳糖醇和甘露醇的共混物；尿素；脲基嘧啶酮；N,N-二烷基哌啶；N,N-二烷基吡咯烷鎓；LiF和BeF2；NaF和BeF2；LiF和NaF和KF；NaF和ZrF4；KNO3和KCl；KNO3和K2CO3；LiBr和KBr；KNO3和KBr；KNO3和LiOH；FeCl2和KCl；KCl和LiCl；K2CO3和KOH；K2SO4和KOH；FeCl2和NaCl；KCl和MnCl2；LiBr和LiI；KCl–MgCl2；MnCl2和NaCl；LiCO3和LiOH；LiBr和LiF；NaCl和MgCl2；K2CO3和MgCO3；KF和KBF4；Na2SO4和ZnSO4；CaCl2和LiCl；LiCl和Li2SO4；KF和LiF；K2CO3和Li2CO3；Li2CO3和Na2CO3；LiCl和LiF；CaCl2和NaCl；KVO3和BaTiO3；KCl和LiBr和NaBr；KBr和LiCl和NaCl；LiBr和NaBr和KBr；NaOH和NaCl和Na2CO3；KCl和LiCl和Li2SO4；MgCl2和KCl和NaCl；NaCl和KCl和FeCl2；KCl和LiCl和CaF2；CaCl2和KCl和LiCl；NaCl和KCl和LiCl；KF和AlF3和ZrF4；MnCl2和KCl和NaCl；Na2SO4和K2SO4和ZnSO4；Na2CO3和K2CO3和ZnSO4；Na2CO3和K2CO3和LiCO3；KCl和NaCl和LiF；LiCl和NaCl和Li2SO4；LiCl和KCl和CaCl2和CaF2；KCl和NaCl和LiCl和Li2SO4；NaNO3；KNO3；KNO3和KCl；KNO3和K2CO3；KNO3和KBr；FeCl2和KCl；KCl和LiCl；K2CO3和KOH；K2SO4和KOH；FeCl2和NaCl；LiBr和KBr；NaOH和NaCl和Na2CO3；MgCl2和KCl和NaCl；NaCl和KCl和FeCl2；CaCl2和KCl和LiCl；MgCl2和KCl和NaCl；MgCl2和KCl和NaCl；NaOH和NaCl和Na2CO3；MnCl2和KCl和NaCl；Na2CO2和K2CO3和Li2CO3；LiF和LiCl和LiVO3和Li2SO4和Li2MoO4；LiF和LiCl和Li2SO4和Li2MoO4；LiF和KF和KCO4和KCl；LiF和LiO

		"description": "Description\n\n用于处理废气的分区的催化剂\n发明领域\n本发明涉及分区的催化剂的系统和用于处理燃烧废气的方法。\n背景技术\n烃基燃料在发动机中的燃烧产生废气，所述废气包含占大部分的相对良性的氮气(N2)、水蒸气(H2O)和二氧化碳(CO2)。但是废气还包含相对较少部分的有害和/或有毒物质，如来自不完全燃烧的一氧化碳 (CO)、来自未燃烧的燃料的烃(HC)、来自过度燃烧温度的氮氧化物 (NOx)和颗粒物质(大部分为碳烟)。为了缓解释放至大气的烟道气和废气的环境影响，希望消除或减少不期望的组分的量，优选通过反过来不产生其它有害或有毒物质的方法。\n典型地，来自贫燃气体发动机的废气由于提供来保证烃燃料的充分燃烧的高份额的氧气而具有净氧化效应。在这样的气体中，最不好除去的组分之一是NOx，其包括一氧化氮(NO)、二氧化氮(NO2)和一氧化二氮(N2O)。NOx至N2的还原因为废气包含足以利于氧化反应而不是还原反应的氧气而是特别成问题的。然而，可以通过通常已知的方法，如选择性催化还原(SCR)还原NOx。SCR方法包括在催化剂存在下并借助于还原剂如氨将NOx转变成单质氮(N2)和水。在SCR方法中，将气态还原剂如氨添加至废气流中，然后使废气与SCR催化剂接触。使还原剂吸收至催化剂上并且在气体通过或经过经催化的基材时发生NOx还原反应。使用氨的化学计量的SCR反应的化学方程式为：\n4NO+4NH3+O2→4N2+6H2O\n2NO2+4NH3+O2→3N2+6H2O\nNO+NO2+2NH3→2N2+3H2O\n已知具有经交换的过渡金属的沸石可用作SCR催化剂。用铜交换的常规小孔沸石尤其可用于在低的温度实现高的NOx转化率。然而，吸收至经交换的沸石的过渡金属上的NO与NH3的相互作用可能导致产生N2O的不期望的副反应。该N2O尤其不好从废气流中除去。因此，存在对导致NOx的高转化率并且最少N2O产生的改进的方法的需求。本发明尤其满足该需求。\n发明简述\n申请人已发现至少两个SCR催化区域(所述区域的一个包含钒基催化剂且另一个包含负载铜的分子筛)的组合可以在SCR反应中大量降低N2O的不期望的产生，同时保持整体上高的N2选择性，条件是所述钒基催化剂在负载铜的分子筛上游。例如，可以通过负载有基于金属氧化物的总重量计约0.5-4重量％的钒的金属氧化物和负载有基于分子筛的总重量计约1-4重量％的铜的下游的小孔分子筛实现高N2选择性和低N2O副产物。在某些实施方案中，上游的钒基催化剂以相对于下游的铜基催化剂更高的载体涂层负载量存在。\n因此，在一个方面中提供了用于处理废气的系统，其包括(a)包含负载在金属氧化物上的钒的第一SCR催化剂区域，所述金属氧化物选自TiO2、ZrO2、SiO2、CeO2和Al2O3；和(b)包含负载铜的小孔分子筛的第二SCR催化剂区域，其中相对于通过所述系统的正常的废气流，将所述第一SCR催化剂区域布置在所述第二SCR催化剂区域的上游。\n在本发明的另一方面中提供了用于处理废气的方法，包括使氨气与来源于内燃机的废气的混合物顺序地与(a)包含负载在金属氧化物上的钒的第一SCR区域(所述金属氧化物选自TiO2、ZrO2、SiO2、CeO2和Al2O3)和(b)包含负载铜的小孔分子筛的第二SCR区域接触的步骤。\n附图简述\n图1是显示具有分区的SCR催化剂布置的本发明的实施方案的图；\n图2是显示具有分区的SCR催化剂的另一布置的本发明的实施方案的图；\n图3是显示具有分区的SCR催化剂的另一布置的本发明的实施方案的图；\n图4是显示具有分区的SCR催化剂的另一布置的本发明的实施方案的图；\n图4A是显示具有分区的SCR催化剂的另一布置的本发明的实施方案的图；\n图5是显示具有分区的SCR催化剂和氨氧化催化剂的布置的本发明的实施方案的图；\n图6是显示具有包括两个基材的分区的SCR催化剂的另一布置的本发明的实施方案的图；\n图6A是显示具有包括两个基材的分区的SCR催化剂和ASC区的另一布置的本发明的实施方案的图；\n图7是显示具有分区的SCR催化剂的另一布置的本发明的实施方案的图，其中区域之一为挤出的催化剂本体形式；\n图7A是显示具有分区的SCR催化剂的另一布置的本发明的实施方案的图，其中区域之一为挤出的催化剂本体形式；\n图8是显示具有分区的SCR催化剂的另一布置的本发明的实施方案的图，其中区域在挤出的催化剂本体上；\n图9是包含分区的SCR催化剂的流通式蜂窝基材的图；\n图9A是流通式蜂窝基材的孔的图；\n图10是根据本发明的实施方案的用于处理废气的系统的图；\n图11A是根据本发明的实施方案的用于处理废气的系统的图；和\n图11B是根据本发明的实施方案的用于处理废气的另一系统的图。\n本发明的优选实施方案的详述\n提供了用于改进环境空气质量，且尤其是用于处理由发电厂、燃气轮机、贫燃内燃机等产生的废气排放物的方法和系统。通过在宽的运行温度范围内降低NOx浓度，至少部分地改进了废气排放物。通过使废气与分区布置的两个或更多个特定的NH3-SCR催化剂接触实现

催化剂区域之间没有催化剂或其它废气处理操作，如过滤器)。因此，在某些实施方案中，相对于通过或经过基材或一系列基材的正常的废气流，第一SCR催化剂区域在第二SCR催化剂区域上游。\n第一和第二SCR催化剂区域的催化剂材料方面的区别导致废气的不同的处理。例如，第一SCR催化剂区域以较低的选择性将NOx还原成副产物(包括在低温还原成N2O)和第二SCR催化剂区域以相对于第一SCR催化剂区域更高的效率有效地还原NOx。两个SCR催化剂区域的组合的协同效应相比于单个催化剂系统或其它分区的布置改进了催化剂的总体性能。优选地，使第一和第二区域接触(即，在第一和第二SCR催化剂区域之间没有介于其间的催化活性层)。\n在图9中显示了分区的催化剂基材2，其中所述基材为相对于废气流1通过基材的正常方向具有入口端110和出口端120的蜂窝流通式整料100。基材具有从入口端110延伸至出口端120的轴向长度190。图10显示了具有限定废气可以流动通过的开放通道120的通道壁110

120从出口端120沿着轴向长度190延伸一定距离，例如轴向长度190 的约20至90％，例如约60至约80％或约50至约75％。优选地，所述第二SCR催化剂区域至少延伸至所述第一端点，从而使得第一和第二SCR催化剂区域接触。轴向长度优选为小于24英寸，如约1至约 24英寸，约3至约12英寸，或约3至约8英寸。\n在图2中显示了优选的实施方案，其中第一SCR催化剂区域20 部分叠盖第二SCR催化剂区域30。在图3中，第二SCR催化剂区域 30部分叠盖第一SCR催化剂区域20。所述叠盖优选为基材的轴向长度的小于90％，例如约80至约90％，小于约40％，约40至约60％，约10至约15％，或约10至约25％。对于其中第二SCR催化剂区域叠盖第一SCR催化剂区域的实施方案，所述叠盖可以为轴向长度的大于50％，如80–90％。对于其中第一SCR催化剂区域叠盖第二SCR 催化剂区域的实施方案，所述叠盖优选为轴向长度的小于50％，例如约10–20％。\n在图4中，第一SCR催化剂区域20完全叠盖第二SCR催化剂区域30。对于这样的实施方案，废气首先接触第一SCR催化剂区域并且被其至少部分地处理。废气的至少一部分渗透通过第一SCR催化剂区域，在此处接触第二SCR催化剂区域并被进一步处理。经处理的废气的至少一部分渗透通回第一SCR催化剂区域，进入开放通道并离开基材。图4显示了其中第一和第二SCR催化剂区域二者延伸基材的整个轴向长度的实施方案。图4A显示了替代性实施方案，其中第二SCR 催化剂区域从出口端延伸至小于基材的全部轴向长度并且第一SCR催化剂区域延伸基材的全部轴向长度，因此完全叠盖第二SCR催化剂区域。\n图5显示了本发明的另一实施方案。在此，第三催化剂区域邻近基材的出口端并且优选从基材的出口端延伸。第三催化剂区域包括氧化催化剂，优选有效氧化氨的催化剂。在某些实施方案中，所述催化剂包括一种或多种铂族金属(PGM)，如Pt、Pd或其组合，其优选在金属氧化物载体如氧化铝上。氧化催化剂可以包括沸石，如FER或

催化剂区域接触第二SCR催化剂区域。在某些实施方案中，将第一和第二SCR催化剂区域涂覆在单独的基材上或以其它方式合并至单独的基材上，将所述基材布置在废气处理系统中，从而使得第一和第二 SCR催化剂区域串联并且接触或被短距离隔开而没有介于其间的废气处理催化剂。当使用两个基材时，所述基材可以是相同或不同的基材。例如，第一基材可以为壁流式过滤器且第二基材可以为流通式蜂窝体，第一和第二基材可以具有不同的孔隙率，第一和第二基材可以为不同的组合物或具有不同的孔密度和/或第一和第二基材可以为不同的长度。在图6中，将第一和第二SCR催化剂区域布置在单独的基材上，所述单独的基材布置在废气处理系统中，从而使得第一和第二 SCR催化剂区域串联并且相邻，但不直接接触。在某些实施方案中，第一和第二基材之间的最大距离优选为小于2英寸，更优选小于1英寸，并且优选在第一和第二SCR催化剂区域之间和/或在第一和第二基材之间不存在介于其间的基材、过滤器或催化剂材料。在图6A中，第二基材还包括氨氧化催化剂下层40，所述下层从基材的出口端延伸至小于基材的总长度的长度。第二SCR催化剂区域完全覆盖氧化性催化剂并且优选延伸基材的长度。\n在某些实施方案中，第一SCR催化剂区域为挤出的蜂窝本体形式。图7中所示的实施方案例如包括在挤出的催化剂基材的一部分之上和/

涂覆。挤出的本体的催化组分可以为被动NOx吸收剂、补充SCR催化剂或用于处理废气的其它催化剂。第一SCR催化剂区域从入口端312延伸至第一端点314，所述第一端点定位在轴向长度390的约10 至80％，例如约50-80％，约10至25％，或约20–30％。第二SCR 催化剂区域从出口端344延伸至第二端点332，所述第二端点定位在轴向长度390的约20至80％，例如约20–40％，约60至约80％，或约50至约75％。第一和第二SCR催化剂区域并不直接接触并且因此在上游区域与下游区域之间存在间隙320。优选地，该间隙不包含催化剂层，而是直接暴露至待处理的废气。废气在间隙处接触催化本体，由此处理废气，例如以选择性还原废气中的一部分NOx。由第一端点 314和第二端点332限定的间隙优选为轴向长度的小于75％，例如轴向长度390的约40至约60％，约10至约15％，或约10至约25％。将任选的NH3氧化催化剂涂覆在从出口端344向入口端312延伸的区域中的基材300之上和/或之内等于或小于下游区域长度的长度。任选的NH3氧化催化剂优选为被形成下游区域的催化剂组合物完全覆盖的下层。\n优选将钒基催化剂以约0.5至约4重量％或约1至2重量％的浓度负载在金属氧化物上，基于金属氧化物载体的总重量计。优选的钒组分包括钒的氧化物如氧化钒(V2O5)和金属钒酸盐(例如FeVO4)和任选的钨的氧化物。在某些实施方案中，钒组分包括至多约25重量％的钨的氧化物，优选约1至约25重量％，更优选约5至约20重量％，且甚至更优选约5至约15重量％，基于钒组分的总重量计。\n金属钒酸盐的合适的金属包括碱土金属、过渡金属、稀土金属或其组合。出于本说明书和权利要求书的目的，术语“碱土金属”意指元素周期表上的第II族元素的至少一种并且“过渡金属”意指元素周期表上的第IV-XI族元素的至少一种和Zn。有用的碱土金属包括Mg、

titanate)。\n优选的过滤器基材包括柴油颗粒物过滤器并且优选的用于移动应用中的柴油颗粒物过滤器包括壁流式过滤器，如壁流式陶瓷整料。其它过滤器基材包括流通式过滤器，如金属或陶瓷泡沫体或纤维过滤器。除了堇青石、碳化硅和陶瓷以外，可用于多孔基材的其它材料包括，但不限于氧化铝二氧化硅、氮化铝、氮化硅、钛酸铝、α-氧化铝、莫来石、铯榴石、锆石、氧化锆、尖晶石、硼化物、长石、二氧化钛、熔融石英、硼化物、陶瓷纤维复合物，这些中任意的混合物，或包含它们的任意两种或更多种的部分的复合物。特别优选的基材包括堇青石、碳化硅和钛酸铝(AT)，其中AT为占优势的晶相。\n壁流式过滤器的多孔壁具有相对于废气流通过所述壁的典型方向的入口侧和出口侧。所述入口侧具有暴露至对基材的前方开放的通道的入口面，并且所述出口侧具有暴露至对基材的后方开放的通道的出口面。\n用于柴油机的壁流式过滤器基材典型地包含约100–800cpsi(每平方英寸的通道数)，例如约100至约400cpsi，约200至约300cpsi，或约500至约600cps。在某些实施方案中，所述壁具有约0.1至约1.5 mm，例如约0.15至约0.25mm，约0.25至约0.35mm，或约0.25至约0.50mm的平均壁厚度。\n用于本发明的壁流式过滤器优选具有至少70％，至少约75％，至少约80％或至少约90％的效率。在某些实施方案中，所述效率将优选为约75至约99％，约75至约90％，约80至约90％或约85至约95％。\n过滤器的孔隙率和平均孔径的有用范围没有特别限制，但与催化剂涂层的粒度和粘度相关或用于测定催化剂涂层的粒度和粘度。如本文中所述，基于裸的过滤器(即没有催化剂涂层)测定过滤器基材的孔隙率和平均孔径。通常，基材的孔隙率为至少约40％，更优选至少约 50％，例如约50至约80％，约50至约70％，或约55至约65％。可以通过任意合适的手段(包括压汞法)测量孔隙率。通常，基材的平均孔径为约8至约40μm，例如约8至约12μm，约12至约20μm，或约15至约25μm。在某些实施方案中，所述孔的至少约50％且更优选至少约75％在这些范围内，基于所述孔的总孔体积和/或总数计。可以通过任意可接受的手段(包括压汞法)测定平均孔径。在某些实施方案中，过滤器基材具有约12至约15μm的平均孔径和约50至约55％的孔隙率。在优选的实施方案中，过滤器基材具有约18至约20μm 的平均孔径和和约55至约65％的孔隙率。\n可以将第一SCR催化剂区域的催化剂载体涂料负载在过滤器壁的入口侧、过滤器壁的出口侧、部分或完全渗透过滤器壁或它们的一些组合。在某些实施方案中，过滤器是本文中所描述的用于第一或第二 SCR催化剂区域的基材。例如，可以将壁流式过滤器用作第一区域的基材和可以将流通式蜂窝体用作第二区域的基材。在另一实例中，可以将流通式蜂窝体用作第一区域的基材和可以将壁流式过滤器用作第二区域的基材。在这样的实施方案中(其中第二基材是壁流式过滤器)，壁流式过滤器可以进一步包括NH3氧化催化剂，以形成ASC区域，优选在过滤器的出口侧上。\n在某些实施方案中，本发明是通过本文中所描述的方法制得的催化剂制品。在特定的实施方案中，通过包括以下步骤的方法制备催化剂制品：在将第二SCR催化基组合物优选作为载体涂层施加至基材之前或之后，将第一SCR催化剂组合物优选作为载体涂层施加至基材作为层。\n在某些实施方案中，将第二SCR催化剂组合物设置在基材上作为顶层并将另一组合物，如氧化催化剂、还原催化剂、清除性组分或NOx储存组分设置在基材上作为底层。\n通常，包含第一SCR催化剂组合物的挤出的固体本体的生产包括将钒组分、金属氧化物载体、任选的WO3、粘结剂、任选的有机粘性增强化合物共混成均质的糊剂，然后将所述糊剂添加至粘结剂/基质组分或其前体和任选的一种或多种稳定化的氧化铈和无机纤维。将共混物在混合或捏合设备或挤出机中压实。混合物具有有机添加剂如粘结剂、成孔剂、塑化剂、表面活性剂、润滑剂、分散剂作为加工助剂，以增强润湿并因此产生均匀的批料。然后将所产生的塑性材料成型，尤其是使用包括挤出模头的挤出机或挤压机，并干燥和煅烧产生的成型体。在煅烧挤出的固体本体期间“烧除”有机添加剂。优选地，使钒组分遍及且优选均匀地遍及整个挤出的催化剂本体分散。\n根据本发明的挤出的催化剂本体通常包括具有从其第一端延伸至第二端的均匀尺寸和平行通道的蜂窝体形式的单一结构。限定所述通道的通道壁是多孔的。典型地，外部“结皮”围绕挤出的固体本体的多个通道。可以由任意期望的截面如圆形、正方形或椭圆形形成挤出的固体本体。在多个通道中的单独的通道可以为正方形、三角形、六边形、圆形等。\n本文中所描述的催化制品可以促进含氮还原剂，优选氨与氮氧化物的反应，以选择性形成单质氮(N2)和水(H2O)。这样的含氮还原剂的实例包括氨和氨联氨或任意合适的氨前体，如尿素((NH2)2CO)、碳酸铵、氨基甲酸铵、碳酸氢铵或甲酸铵。本发明的SCR方法可以在宽的温度范围(例如，约150–700℃，约200–350℃，约350–550℃，或约 450–550℃)导致至少75％，优选至少80％，且更优选至少90％的NOx (NO和/或NO2)转化率。\n废气处理系统可以包括布置在催化制品上游的含氮还原剂的外部来源(例如氨或尿素喷射器)和/或NAC。所述系统可以包括控制器，用于仅在确定SCR催化剂区域能够例如在高于100℃，高于150℃或高于175℃以等于或高于期望的效率催化NOx还原时，将外部含氮还原剂计量至流动的废气中。可以布置含氮还原剂的计量，从而使得以1:1 NH3/NO和4:3NH3/NO2计算，进入SCR催化剂的废气中存在理论的氨的60％至200％。\n重要的是，使用根据本发明的分区的催化剂产生比常规SCR催化剂低的量的N2O副产物。也就是说，本发明方法的SCR方法可以导致基于在SCR入口处的NO和/或NO2的低的N2O生成。例如，在SCR 催化剂处的入口NO浓度相比于在SCR催化剂之后的出口N2O浓度的相对比例在宽的温度范围(例如，约150–700℃，约200–350℃，约 350–550℃，或约450–550℃)内为大于约25，大于约30(例如约30至约40)，大于约50，大于约80或大于约100。在另一实例中，在SCR 催化剂处的入口NO2浓度相比于在SCR催化剂之后的出口N2O浓度的相对比例在宽的温度范围(例如，约150–700℃，约200–350℃，约 350–550℃，或约450–550℃)内为大于约50，大于约80或大于约100。\n本文中描述的负载金属的分子筛催化剂可以促进氨的储存和氧化或可以与氧化催化剂如负载在氧化铝上的铂和/或钯结合，也可以促进氨的氧化和通过氧化过程限制NOx的不期望的形成(即氨泄漏催化剂 (ASC))。在某些实施方案中，本发明的催化制品包含在基材的出口端的ASC区域。在其它实施方案中，氨泄漏催化剂设置在分区的SCR 催化剂的下游的单独的砖上。这些单独的砖可以彼此邻近和彼此接触或分开特定距离，条件是它们彼此流体连通并且条件是将SCR催化剂砖设置在氨泄漏催化剂砖上游。\n在某些实施方案中，SCR和/或ASC过程在至少100℃的温度进行。在另一实施方案中，所述一个或多个过程在约150℃至约750℃的温度发生。在特定的实施方案中，温度范围为约175至约550℃。在另一实施方案中，温度范围为175至400℃。在又一实施方案中，温度范围为450至900℃，优选500至750℃，500至650℃，450至550℃或 650至850℃。\n根据本发明的另一方面，提供了用于在气体中还原NOx化合物和/

化剂上游的(总体NAC)。在某些实施方案中，将NAC涂覆在与分区 的SCR催化剂相同的流通式基材上。在这样的实施方案中，将NAC 和SCR催化剂顺序地涂覆，其中NAC在SCR区域上游。\n可用于本发明中的NAC组分包括碱性物质(如碱金属，碱土金属 或稀土金属，包括碱金属的氧化物，碱土金属的氧化物及其组合)和贵 金属(如铂)和任选的还原催化剂组分如铑的催化剂组合。可用于NAC

520、任选的颗粒物过滤器570、任选的氨和注射器的外部来源 530、包括第一和第二SCR催化剂区域的分区的SCR催化剂540、任选的额外的SCR催化剂550和任选的ASC 560。\n图11A示出了废气处理系统，其包括在包含第一SCR催化剂区域的壁流式过滤器620上游的被动NOx吸收剂(PNA)610，所述第一SCR

		"description": "Description\n\n组合SCR与PNA用于低温排放控制\n\n发明领域\n本发明涉及包括选择性催化还原(SCR)催化剂和被动NOX吸附剂催化剂的催化制品的用途。这些催化剂可以以具有底层和顶层的分层系统的方式布置，所述低层包括在氧化铈上的钯或金属沸石充当NOX吸附剂催化剂并且也可以提供氨泄漏控制以及烃(HC)和一氧化碳(CO)转化，所述顶层包含SCR催化剂。替代性地，这些催化剂可以分区或可以在单个载体涂层中组合。\n\n\n发明背景\n烃基燃料在发动机中的燃烧产生废气，其主要包含相对良性的氮气(N2)、水蒸气(H2O)和二氧化碳(CO2)。但是废气也相对少地包含有害和/或有毒物质，如来自不完全燃烧的一氧化碳(CO)、来自未燃烧的燃料的烃(HC)、来自过度的燃烧温度的氮氧化物(NOx)和颗粒物质(主要为碳烟)。为了缓和释放至大气中的烟道气和废气的环境影响，期望的是优选通过反过来不产生其它有害或有毒物质的方法消除或减少不期望的组分的量。\n典型地，来自贫燃气体发动机的废气由于提供来确保烃燃料充分燃烧的高份额的氧气而具有净氧化效应。在这样的气体中，要除去的最麻烦的组分之一是NOX，其包括一氧化氮(NO)和二氧化氮(NO2)。因为废气包含足够的氧气而有助于氧化反应而不是还原，所以NOX到N2的还原是特别成问题的。尽管如此，可以通过通常被称为选择性催化还原(SCR)的方法还原NOX。SCR方法包括将NOX在催化剂存在下并借助于含氮还原性试剂如氨转化成单质氮(N2)和水。在SCR方法中，将气态还原剂如氨添加至废气流，然后使废气与SCR催化剂接触。将还原剂吸附至催化剂上并随着气体穿过或经过经催化的基材而进行NOx还原反应。使用氨的化学计量SCR反应的化学方程式为：\n4NO+4NH3+O2→4N2+6H2O\n2NO2+4NH3+O2→3N2+6H2O\nNO+NO2+2NH3→2N2+3H2O\nNH3 SCR排放控制系统一旦达到它们的运行温度(典型地200℃以上)时是非常有效的。然而，这些系统在低于它们的运行温度时(“冷启动”时期)是相对低效率的。例如，为了满足欧6排放所实施的目前的尿素基选择性催化还原(SCR)应用需要在尿素计量添加位置处的温度为高于约180℃，然后可以计量添加尿素并将其用于转化NOx。低于180℃的NOx转化难于使用目前的系统解决并且将来欧洲和美国的法规将会对低温NOx转化施加压力。尽管SCR催化剂由于存在NO2得以促进，但是在低温下存在有限的NO2，这是由于DOC的低NO氧化活性，或任何发动机排出的NO2通过HC或CO在DOC上还原成NO，从而使得在SCR前NOx主要以NO存在。可以通过加热策略控制低温NOx排放，但这具有CO2排放的有害影响。由于甚至更严厉的国家和地区法规降低了可以从柴油发动机排放的污染物的量，冷启动时间期间降低排放变成主要挑战。因此，继续开发用于降低在冷启动条件期间排放的NOx的水平的方法。本发明通过组合可以在低温捕获NOX的被动NOX吸附剂催化剂与NH3 SCR催化剂解决该问题。PNA可以提供控制NH3泄漏以及CO和HC排放的额外的益处。\n\n\n发明简述\n在本发明的一个方面，催化剂制品包括SCR催化剂和NOx吸附剂催化剂，其中所述NOx吸附剂催化剂包括在氧化铈上的钯或含金属的分子筛，其中所述金属选自铈、铬、钴、铜、铁、镧、锰、钼、镍、铌、钯、银、钨、钒和锌，及其混合物。\n在本发明的另一个方面，催化剂制品包括(a)包括SCR催化剂的第一层和包括NOx吸附剂催化剂的第二层，或(b)包括NOx吸附剂催化剂的第一层和包括SCR催化剂的第二层，其中所述层作为覆盖层和下层或作为两个相邻的层存在并且第一层在第二层之前接触废气流。\n在本发明的又一方面，催化剂制品包括SCR催化剂和NOx吸附剂催化剂，其中NOx吸附剂催化剂中的分子筛与SCR催化剂中的含金属的分子筛中的分子筛相同，并且NOx吸附剂催化剂中的金属和SCR催化剂中的金属与分子筛组合。\n在本发明的另一方面，催化剂制品包括SCR催化剂和NOx吸附剂催化剂，其中NOx吸附剂催化剂中的分子筛不同于SCR催化剂中的含金属的分子筛中的分子筛，NOx吸附剂催化剂中的金属为与NOx吸附剂催化剂中的分子筛第一组合，SCR催化剂中的金属为与SCR催化剂中的分子筛第二组合，并且所述第一组合和第二组分作为第三组合存在。\n在本发明的再一方面，包括SCR催化剂和NOx吸附剂催化剂的催化剂制品可以进一步包括流通式基材或壁流式过滤器。当催化剂制品包括流通式基材并且第一层为在基材的上游部分上的涂层和将第二层涂覆在基材的下游部分上时，可以将SCR催化剂设置在基材的下游部分中的流通式基材上并且可以将NOx吸附剂催化剂设置在基材的上游部分中的流通式基材上。当所述催化剂制品包括壁流式过滤器时，包括SCR催化剂的第一层可以为在所述过滤器的出口侧上的涂层和包括NOx吸附剂催化剂的第二层可以为在所述过滤器的入口侧上的涂层。\n在本发明的再一方面，催化剂制品包括：挤出的整料基材，其中：(a)挤出的基材包括SCR催化剂和NOx吸附剂催化剂以层的形式设置在挤出的基材上，或(b)挤出的基材包括NOx吸附剂催化剂和将SCR催化剂以层的形式设置在挤出的基材上；或(c)挤出的基材包括SCR催化剂和NOx吸附剂催化剂。\n在本发明的另一方面，催化载体涂料包括SCR催化剂、NOx吸附剂催化剂和至少一种粘结剂，其中所述SCR催化剂包括选自铈、铬、钴、铜、镓、铟、铱、铁、锰、钼、镍、钯、铂、钌、铼、银、锡和锌的金属；所述NOx吸附剂催化剂包括分子筛和选自铈、钴、铁、镧、锰、钼、铌、钯、钨、银和锌的金属，其中：(a)所述SCR催化剂中的金属和所述NOx吸附催化剂中的金属不同，或(b)SCR催化剂中的金属和NOx吸附催化剂中的金属相同，和(i)仅NOx吸附催化剂包括分子筛或(ii)SCR催化剂中的分子筛不同于NOx吸附催化剂中的分子筛，和所述至少一种粘结剂选自氧化铝、二氧化硅、非沸石二氧化硅-氧化铝、天然粘土、TiO2、ZrO2和SnO2。\n在本发明的另一个方面，废气系统包括催化剂制品，所述催化剂制品包括SCR催化剂和NOx吸附剂催化剂和紧耦合的催化碳烟过滤器(CSF)，其中所述NOx吸附剂催化剂包括在氧化铈上的钯或分散在分子筛上的选自铈、钴、铁、镧、锰、钼、铌、钯、钨、银和锌的金属。催化碳烟过滤器可以位于废气流动方向的催化剂制品的下游或上游。\n在本发明的再一方面，用于制备氨泄漏催化剂的方法包括：(a)通过向基材上施加包括NOx吸附剂催化剂的底层载体涂料(washcoat)在基材上形成底层，所述NOx吸附剂催化剂包括分散在分子筛上的选自铈、钴、铁、镧、锰、钼、铌、钯、钨、银和锌的金属；(b)干燥在基材上的底层载体涂层(washcoat)，(c)煅烧在基材上的底层载体涂层；(d)通过在步骤(c)中形成的经煅烧的底层上方施加包括SCR催化剂的顶层载体涂料形成位于底层上方的顶层，(e)干燥在基材上的经煅烧的底层上的顶层载体涂层，和(f)煅烧在基材上的底层载体涂层上的顶层载体涂层。在本发明的另一个方面，用于制备氨泄漏催化剂的方法包括相同的步骤，不同之处在于将SCR催化剂置于底层中并且将NOx吸附剂催化剂置于顶层中。\n在本发明的再一方面，用于处理废气的方法包括使具有一定浓度的NOx的废气流与含氮还原剂在约150℃至约750℃的温度在催化剂制品存在下接触，所述催化剂制品包括：(a)具有入口面端和出口面和从所述入口面至所述出口面的气体流的轴线的壁流式整料；(b)包括第一层和第二层的组合物，所述第一层包括SCR催化剂并且所述第二层包括NOx捕集催化剂，所述NOx捕集催化剂包括在氧化铈上的钯或含金属的分子筛，其中所述金属选自铈、钴、铁、镧、锰、钼、铌、钯、钨、银和锌，其中布置所述第一层以在第二层之前接触废气，和(c)任选的包括第一层和第二层的第二组合物，所述第一层包括第二SCR催化剂并且所述第二层包括贵金属，其中布置所述第一层以在第二层之前接触废气；其中将所述第一和第二组合物设置在壁流式整料的一部分之内并且沿着轴线串联，和其中将所述第一组合物设置成邻近所述入口面并且将第二区设置成邻近所述出口面。\n在本发明的再一方面，用于降低废气流中的氨、NOx、一氧化碳和烃的一者或多者的浓度的方法包括使包含氨、NOx、一氧化碳和/或烃的废气流与包括第一层和第二层的氨泄漏催化剂接触，所述第一层包括SCR催化剂并且所述第二层包括NOx吸附剂催化剂，所述NOx吸附剂催化剂包括在氧化铈上的钯或含金属的分子筛，其中所述金属选自铈、钴、铁、镧、锰、钼、铌、钯、钨、银和锌，其中布置所述第一层以在第二层之前接触废气。SCR催化剂和NOx吸附剂催化剂可以位于流通式基材或壁流式过滤器中。在本发明的又一方面，用于降低废气流中的氨、一氧化碳和烃的一者或多者的浓度的方法包括上述步骤，不同之处在于第一和第二层的取向使得布置所述第二层以在第一层之前接触废气。\n在本发明的另一个方面，用于减少废气中的氨、NOx、CO和烃的至少一者的方法包括使气体与催化剂制品接触足以降低气体中的氨、NOx、CO和烃中的至少一者的水平的时间和温度，所述催化剂制品包括：(a)具有入口面端和出口面和从所述入口面至所述出口面的气体流的轴线的壁流式整料；(b)包括第一SCR催化剂的第一层和包括NOx吸附剂催化剂的第二层，所述NOx吸附剂催化剂包括在氧化铈上的钯或含金属的分子筛，所述金属选自铈、钴、铁、镧、锰、钼、铌、钯、钨、银和锌，其中布置所述第二层以在第一层之前接触废气，和任选地(c)包括第一层和第二层的第二组合物，所述第一层包括第二SCR催化剂并且所述第二层包括贵金属，其中布置所述第一层以在第二层之前接触废气；其中所述第一和第二组合物设置在壁流式整料的一部分之内并且沿着轴线串联，和其中将所述第一组合物设置成邻近所述入口面并且将第二区设置成邻近所述出口面。\n在本发明的另一个方面，用于降低废气中的氨、NOx、CO和THC的至少一者的浓度的方法包括使包含氨、NOx、CO和THC的废气流与如本文中所述的催化剂制品接触足以降低气体中的氨、NOx、CO和THC中的至少一者的水平的时间和温度。\n在本发明的再一方面，用于在发动机的冷启动期间降低废气流中的NOx的浓度的方法包括使包含NOx的废气流与如本文中所描述的催化剂制品接触，其中通过烃SCR还原储存的NOx。\n在本发明的又一方面，氨泄漏催化剂包括入口区和出口区，其中将SCR催化剂定位在所述入口区内并将NOx吸附剂催化剂定位在所述出口区内，其中所述NOx吸附剂催化剂包括含金属的分子筛，其中所述金属选自铈、钴、铁、镧、锰、钼、铌、钯、钨、银和锌，其中所述SCR催化剂和所述NOx吸附剂催化剂的至少一者位于壁流式过滤器上。\n在本发明的另一个方面，催化剂制品包括SCR催化剂和NOx吸附剂催化剂，其中所述SCR催化剂包括含金属的分子筛，其中所述金属选自铈、铜、铁和锰及其混合物，和所述NOx吸附剂催化剂包括含金属的分子筛，其中所述金属选自钯或银及其混合物，其中所述SCR催化剂和所述NOx吸附剂催化剂包括相同的分子筛，和所述SCR催化剂的金属和所述NOx吸附剂催化剂的金属二者在所述分子筛中交换和/或取代。\n在本发明的又一方面，制备本文中所描述的包括SCR催化剂和NOx吸附剂催化剂的催化剂制品的方法包括：(a)将选自铈、铜、铁和锰及其混合物的第一金属添加至分子筛以形成包含所述第一金属的分子筛；(b)煅烧所述包含所述第一金属的分子筛以形成第一经煅烧的分子筛；(c)将选自钯或银及其混合物的第二金属添加至所述第一经煅烧的分子筛以形成包含所述第一金属和所述第二金属的分子筛；和(d)煅烧包含所述第一金属和所述第二金属的分子筛。\n在本发明的再一方面，用于在发动机冷启动期间降低废气流中的NOx浓度的方法包括使包含NOx的废气流与本文中所描述的包括SCR催化剂和NOx吸附剂催化剂的催化剂制品接触，在发动机冷启动期间将NOx储存在所述催化剂制品中，和通过烃SCR还原储存的NOx。\n\n\n附图简述\n在结合附图阅读时由以下详述可以理解本发明。\n图1是图解MVEG测试规程的图。\n图2A-2G是显示SCR催化剂和NOx吸附剂催化剂的位置的催化剂制品构造的图。\n图3是图解使用对比实施例1和2以及实施例3-5的组合物的NOx转化率的图。\n图4是显示来自具有分散在CHA上的不同量的铜和1％Pd的催化剂在750℃老化之后在不同温度所吸附的NO2量(以g/L计)的图。\n图5是显示来自具有分散在CHA上的不同量的铜和1％Pd的催化剂在750℃老化和在150℃的NO储存之后在TPD期间的NOx释放的图。\n图6是显示在NH3

Scientific Publications，Oxford(1997)。XML在线更正版：http://goldbook.iupac.org(2006-)，由M.Nic,J.Jirat,B.Kosata创建；由A.Jenkins编译更新，ISBN

Directive 90/C81/01中所描述进行并且包括四个没有中断地重复的ECE部分，之后是一个EUDC(欧洲城市驾驶循环)部分。在该规程下评价时显示车辆随时间的车辆速度的图示于图1中。\n如本文中所使用的术语“约”意指大约并且是指所述术语有关的所述值的任选±25％，优选±10％，更优选±5％或最优选±1％的范围。\n除非另外指明，当为各种数值要素提供一个或多个范围时，所述一个或多个范围可以包括所述值。\n本发明涉及这样的发现，在本文中所描述的方向上SCR催化剂与NOx吸附剂催化剂下层的组合提供了明显的烃和二氧化碳转化并且提供了在发动机冷启动期间NOx储存的额外的益处，如MVEG测试循环中所示。所述NOx吸附剂催化剂包括在氧化铈上的钯或含金属的分子筛，其中所述金属选自特定的金属的组。使用紧耦合SCR系统的风险在于，由于较高的热质基材如过滤器上的氧化催化剂的较冷的下游位置，HC/CO转化率将会降低。还需要在开始计量添加/SCR起燃之前的NOx去除。本文中所描述的发明涉及这样的发现，在冷启动阶段期间，如本文所述通过SCR催化剂与NOx吸附剂催化剂下层的组合减少了烃。该系统提供了相比于DOC+SCRF系统的NOx性能优势。NOx吸附剂下层还提供了NH3泄漏控制，而不影响循环上的NOx转化率。使用SCR与NOx吸附剂下层还为DOC/CSF的下游远端地板下位置中的SCR提供了益处，在SCR起燃和还原剂计量添加之前在低温的NOx储存，和NH3泄漏控制，使得能够在较高的NH3填充水平操作而允许最大NOx转化。\n也可以将NOx吸附性下层用于能够过滤器上的SCR(SCRF)内的一体化的NH3泄漏控制。涂覆在出口通道中的NOx吸附剂组分将会提供NH3泄漏控制以及另外的HC/CO转化，而不负面地影响NOx转化率。\n如本文中所描述的SCR和NOx吸附剂催化剂的组合除了提供增加的HC、CO和NOx去除和选择性NH3泄漏功能以外，还降低了对于下游氧化涂层性能的要求。通过在SCR起燃和还原剂计量添加之前提供NOx储存，如在低温的NO(接通至～180℃)那样，还将存在对于SCRF或DOC/CSF下游的SCR的益处。低温NOx储存是重要的，因为对于低于CSF NO和HC氧化起燃的温度而言，发动机排出的NO2与HC在DOC上反应，从而在SCR之前NOx主要为NO。NOx吸附剂下层提供了NH3泄漏控制，使得在较高NH3填充水平的SCR运行，从而产生较高的NOx转化率，特别是在低温、低NO2条件下。\n催化剂制品包括SCR催化剂和NOx吸附剂催化剂，其中所述NOx吸附剂催化剂包括含金属的分子筛，其中所述金属选自铈、钴、铁、镧、锰、钼、铌、钯、钨、银和锌，并且当所述SCR催化剂包括金属时，所述NOx吸附剂催化剂中的金属和所述SCR催化剂中的金属是不同的金属。\n\n催化剂\n\nSCR催化剂\nSCR催化剂可以包括贱金属、贱金属的氧化物、负载在混合氧化物上的金属、分子筛、含金属的分子筛或其混合物。贱金属可以选自铈(Ce)、铬(Cr)、钴(Co)、铜(Cu)、铁(Fe)、锰(Mn)、钼(Mo)、镍(Ni)、钨(W)和钒(V)及其混合物。由负载在耐火金属氧化物如氧化铝、二氧化硅、氧化锆、二氧化钛、氧化铈及其组合上的钒组成的SCR组合物是公知并且在移动应用中商业上广泛使用的。典型的组合物描述于美国专利号4,010,238和4,085,193中，通过引用将其全部内容并入本文。商业上使用的，特别是在移动应用中的组合物包括TiO2，向其上已分别以5至20重量％和0.5至6重量％范围的浓度分散有WO3和V2O5。\nSCR催化剂可以包括在氧化铈上掺杂的钒、铌、钽和/或钨。优选地，钒、铌、钽和/或钨以0.1至9重量％存在于氧化铈上并且氧化铈以经钒、铌、钽和/或钨掺杂的氧化铈的至少91重量％存在。\nSCR催化剂可以包括负载在混合氧化物上的金属，其包括由以下组成的至少一种催化组分：(i)分散在由铈和锆组成的作为载体材料的混合氧化物或复合氧化物或其混合物上的至少一种过渡金属；或(ii)分散在惰性氧化物载体材料上的作为单一氧化物或其复合氧化物或所述单一氧化物和所述复合氧化物的混合物的氧化铈和氧化锆，其中至少一种过渡金属分散在其上，其中所述至少一种过渡金属选自第VIB族金属、第IB族金属、第IVA族金属、第VB族金属、第VIIB族金属、第VIII族金属及其任意两种或多种的混合物，条件是至少一种所选择的过渡金属为钨，条件是催化组分中作为氧化物的铈和锆的内含物为CexZr1-xO2，其中X＝0.1-0.9，优选X＝0.2-0.5。该类型的SCR催化剂描述于美国专利申请号2012/0141347，通过引用将全部内容并入本文。\nSCR催化剂可以包括分子筛或含金属的分子筛。如本文中使用的“含金属的分子筛”意指金属交换的或金属取代的分子筛。SCR催化剂可以包括铝硅酸盐分子筛、铝磷酸盐分子筛、硅铝磷酸盐分子筛、含金属的铝硅酸盐分子筛、含金属的铝磷酸盐分子筛或含金属的硅铝磷酸盐分子筛。优选地，所述分子筛为含金属的分子筛。如本文中所使用的术语“分子筛”包括由以下材料制成的分子筛：铝硅酸盐、含金属的铝硅酸盐、铝磷酸盐(AlPO)、含金属的铝磷酸盐(MeAlPO)、硅铝磷酸盐(SAPO)和含金属的硅铝磷酸盐(MeAPSO)分子筛。该术语包括传统的沸石类分子筛，其已被限制为具有国际沸石协会(IZA)发表的沸石结构数据库中所列出的任一种骨架结构的微孔铝硅酸盐。本领域普通技术人员会认识到也将上述其它家族视为沸石。\nSCR催化剂可以包括小孔、中孔或大孔分子筛或其组合。小孔分子筛包含由至多八个四面体原子限定的通道。中孔分子筛包含由十元环限定的通道。大孔分子筛包含由十二元环限定的通道。\nSCR催化剂可以包含选自以下的小孔分子筛：铝硅酸盐分子筛、含金属的铝硅酸盐分子筛、铝磷酸盐(AlPO)分子筛、含金属的铝磷酸盐(MeAlPO)分子筛、硅铝磷酸盐(SAPO)分子筛和含金属的硅铝磷酸盐(MeAPSO)分子筛及其混合物。SCR催化剂可以包括选自以下的骨架类型的小孔分子筛：ACO、AEI、AEN、AFN、AFT、AFX、ANA、APC、APD、ATT、CDO、CHA、DDR、DFT、EAB、EDI、EPI、ERI、GIS、GOO、IHW、ITE、ITW、LEV、KFI、MER、MON、NSI、OWE、PAU、PHI、RHO、RTH、SAT、SAV、SIV、THO、TSC、UEI、UFI、VNI、YUG和ZON及其混合物和/或共生体。优选地，小孔分子筛选自以下的骨架类型：CHA、LEV、AEI、AFX、ERI、SFW、KFI、DDR和ITE。\nSCR催化剂可以包括选自以下的骨架类型的中孔分子筛：AEL、AFO、AHT、BOF、BOZ、CGF、CGS、CHI、DAC、EUO、FER、HEU、IMF、ITH、ITR、JRY、JSR、JST、LAU、LOV、MEL、MFI、MFS、MRE、MTT、MVY、MWW、NAB、NAT、NES、OBW、-PAR、PCR、PON、PUN、RRO、RSN、SFF、SFG、STF、STI、STT、STW、-SVR、SZR、TER、TON、TUN、UOS、VSV、WEI和WEN及其混合物和/或共生体。优选地，中孔分子筛选自以下的骨架类型：FER、MEL、MFI和STT。\nSCR催化剂可以包括选自以下类型的大孔分子筛：AFI、AFR、AFS、AFY、ASV、ATO、ATS、BEA、BEC、BOG、BPH、BSV、CAN、CON、CZP、DFO、EMT、EON、EZT、FAU、GME、GON、IFR、ISV、ITG、IWR、IWS、IWV、IWW、JSR、LTF、LTL、MAZ、MEI、MOR、MOZ、MSE、MTW、NPO、OFF、OKO、OSI、-RON、RWY、SAF、SAO、SBE、SBS、SBT、SEW、SFE、SFO、SFS、SFV、SOF、SOS、STO、SSF、SSY、USI、UWY和VET及其混合物和/或共生体。优选地，大孔分子筛选自以下的骨架类型：AFI、BEA、MAZ、MOR和OFF。\nSCR催化剂可以包括分子筛或含金属的分子筛，其中所述分子筛或所述含金属的分子筛中的分子筛包括选自以下的骨架类型：AEI、BEA(β沸石)、CHA(菱沸石)、FAU(沸石Y)、FER(镁碱沸石)、MFI(ZSM-5)和MOR(丝光沸石)。骨架结构包括，但不限于CHA、FAU、BEA、MFI、MOR类型的那些。具有这些结构的沸石的非限制性实例包括菱沸石、八面沸石、沸石Y、超稳定沸石Y、β沸石、丝光沸石、硅沸石、沸石X和ZSM-5。铝硅酸盐沸石可以具有至少约5，优选至少约20的定义为SiO2/Al2O3的二氧化硅/氧化铝摩尔比(SAR)，其中有用的范围为约10至200。\n含金属的分子筛可以具有沉积至分子筛的外表面上或通道、空腔或笼内的骨架外位点上的来自元素周期表第VB、VIB、VIIB、VIIIB、IB或IIB族之一的至少一种金属。金属可以呈若干种形式之一，包括但不限于，零价金属原子或簇、单独的阳离子、单核或多核氧阳离子或作为扩展的金属氧化物。优选地，所述金属选自铈、铬、钴、铜、镓、铟、铱、铁、锰、钼、镍、钯、铂、钌、铼、银、锡和锌。更优选地，所述金属为铜。\n含金属的分子筛可以包含在约0.10重量％和约10重量％范围内的位于分子筛的外表面上或通道、空腔或笼内的骨架外位点上第VB、VIB、VIIB、VIIIB、IB或IIB族金属。优选地，骨架外金属可以以在约0.2重量％和约5重量％范围内的量存在。含金属的分子筛中的金属的重量％是金属的重量除以金属和分子筛的总重量乘以100。\nSCR催化剂可以以约0.5至约4.0g/in3的浓度存在于催化剂制品中。存在于催化剂制品中的SCR的量可以取决于制品中的SCR催化剂的类型。当所述SCR催化剂包括贱金属或其氧化物时，所述贱金属可以以基于SCR催化剂总重量的0.01至20重量％的浓度存在。当所述SCR催化剂包括分子筛或含金属的分子筛时，所述分子筛可以以基于SCR催化剂总重量的40至100重量％的浓度存在。\n\nNOx吸附剂\n\nNOx吸附剂包括在氧化铈上的钯或含金属的分子筛，其中所述金属选自铈、铬、钴、铜、铁、镧、锰、钼、镍、铌、钯、钨、银、钒和锌及其混合物。优选地，所述金属为钴、锰、钯或锌。更优选地，所述金属为钯或锌。最优选地，SCR催化剂中的金属为铜和NOx吸附剂催化剂中的金属为钯。NOx吸附剂催化剂中的含金属的分子筛中的分子筛可以包括铝硅酸盐、铝磷酸盐、硅铝磷酸盐，如上文在SCR催化剂中的分子筛的描述中所述。当SCR催化剂包括含金属的分子筛时，SCR催化剂中的含金属的分子筛中的分子筛可以为NOx吸附剂催化剂的含金属的分子筛中相同的分子筛，或SCR催化剂中的含金属的分子筛中的分子筛可以不同于NOx吸附剂催化剂的含金属的分子筛中的分子筛。\nNOx吸附剂催化剂的含金属的分子筛中的分子筛可以为小孔、中孔或大孔分子筛，如在SCR催化剂中所描述。NOx吸附剂催化剂的含金属的分子筛中的分子筛优选为小孔分子筛，如上文在SCR催化剂中所描述。小孔分子筛可以包括选自以下的骨架类型：ACO、AEI、AEN、AFN、AFT、AFX、ANA、APC、APD、ATT、CDO、CHA、DDR、DFT、EAB、EDI、EPI、ERI、GIS、GOO、IHW、ITE、ITW、LEV、KFI、MER、MON、NSI、OWE、PAU、PHI、RHO、RTH、SAT、SAV、SIV、THO、TSC、UEI、UFI、VNI、YUG和ZON及其混合物或共生体。优选地，小孔分子筛为菱沸石(CHA)或AEI。优选的中孔分子筛包括FER、MEL、MFI和STT。优选的大孔分子筛包括AFI、BEA、MAZ、MOR和OFF。优选地，含金属的分子筛中的分子筛包括铝硅酸盐或铝磷酸盐，其具有包括端点的5至100的SAR。当含钯的分子筛为含钯的硅铝磷酸盐时，优选所述硅铝磷酸盐包括介于5％和15％之间(包括端点)的二氧化硅。\nNOx吸附剂催化剂中的金属可以以0.01至20重量％的浓度存在。含金属的分子筛可以以约0.5至约4.0g/in3的浓度存在于催化剂制品中。\n\nSCR催化剂和NOx吸附剂催化剂的混合物\n\n催化剂制品可以包括SCR催化剂和NOx吸附剂催化剂，其中所述SCR催化剂包括含金属的分子筛，其中所述金属选自铈、铜、铁和锰及其混合物，和所述NOx吸附剂催化剂包括含金属的分子筛，其中所述金属选自钯或银及其混合物，其中SCR催化剂和NOx吸附剂催化剂包括相同的分子筛并且SCR催化剂的金属和NOx吸附剂催化剂的金属二者在所述分子筛中交换和/或取代。\nSCR和NOx吸附剂催化剂中的含金属的分子筛中的分子筛可以包括铝硅酸盐、铝磷酸盐或硅铝磷酸盐。NOx吸附剂催化剂的含金属的分子筛中的分子筛优选为小孔分子筛。优选地，NOx吸附剂催化剂的含金属的分子筛中的分子筛包括选自以下的骨架类型：ACO、AEI、AEN、AFN、AFT、AFX、ANA、APC、APD、ATT、CDO、CHA、DDR、DFT、EAB、EDI、EPI、ERI、GIS、GOO、IHW、ITE、ITW、LEV、KFI、MER、MON、NSI、OWE、PAU、PHI、RHO、RTH、SAT、SAV、SIV、THO、TSC、UEI、UFI、VNI、YUG和ZON，及其混合物或共生体。更优选地，所述分子筛包括AEI或CHA骨架类型。\n描述了制备包括SCR催化剂和NOx吸附剂催化剂的催化剂制品的方法，其中所述SCR催化剂包括含金属的分子筛，其中所述金属选自铈、铜、铁和锰及其混合物，和所述NOx吸附剂催化剂包括含金属的分子筛，其中所述金属选自钯或银及其混合物，其中所述SCR催化剂和NOx吸附剂催化剂包括相同的分子筛并且SCR催化剂的金属和NOx吸附剂催化剂的金属二者在所述分子筛中交换和/或取代。所述方法包括：(a)将选自铈、铜、铁和锰及其混合物的第一金属添加至分子筛以形成包含所述第一金属的分子筛；(b)煅烧所述包含所述第一金属的分子筛以形成第一经煅烧的分子筛；(c)将选自钯或银及其混合物的第二金属添加至所述第一经煅烧的分子筛以形成包含所述第一金属和所述第二金

CHA或Cu CHA的单一组分。\n\n\n\n\n\n \n一种组分\n\n\n对比催化剂6：\n1重量％Pd CHA\n\n\n对比催化剂7：\n2.5重量％Cu CHA\n\n\n\n\n\n以下催化剂8-12的每一种具有两种组分，其中第一组分包括如下指明的量的CuCHA并且第二组分包括1重量％Pd。Cu组分为首先浸渍在菱沸石上并煅烧，然后浸渍给定浓度的Pd组分。在100℃干燥之后，将样品在500℃煅烧。然后将样品在750℃在包含10％H2O的空气气氛中水热老化。\n\n\n\n\n\n

CHA\n\n\n\n\n\n使用0.4克在250<d<355微米之间筛分的粉末催化剂和300L*hr-1*g-1的MHSV下2升/分的体积气体流量，在气体混合物中评价这些催化剂的被动NOx吸附(PNA)活性，所述气体混合物包含200ppm NO、200ppm CO、50ppm C10H22、12％O2、5％CO2和5％H2O，气体的其余部分为氮气。系统处于100℃的初始温度。在测试期间，将气体混合物从催化剂转移第一分钟，然后在所述温度转换通过样品2分钟。该吸附阶段之后为在含NO的气体存在下的上升速率为10℃/分钟的程序升温脱附(TPD)，直至床温达到约400℃，从而吹扫所有储存NOx的催化剂用于进一步测试。使用傅里叶变换红外(FTIR)光谱定量存在于气体中的NOx的量。\n图3显示了存在于气体中的NOx的量与时间的函数。所述图显示了约1分钟至约2至3分钟的NOx浓度方面的降低。NOx浓度方面降低和时间长度缩短越大，吸附的NOx量越大。没有Pd的催化剂具有最少的NOx吸附。包含1％Pd催化剂中的NOx吸附的量随着Cu的量降低而增加。仅具有1％Pd而没有任何Cu的催化剂经第一个约2分钟提供了最多的NOx吸附。然而，具有少于3.3重量％Cu的Cu负载量的大多数Pd-Cu/CHA催化剂显示出对吸附NOx的高亲和力。在80℃、150℃和170℃的温度重复NOx吸附测量并且计算在这些温度的NOx容量。关于包含3g/in3的催化剂负载量的整料以每升催化剂储存的NO2的量的形式计算NOx储存。图4显示了温度对吸附的NO2的量的影响，以g/升计。所吸附的NO2的量从100℃至170℃相对恒定。具有仅一种包含1重量％Pd CHA的组分的对比催化剂6在80℃至170℃的温度提供了最大量的NO2吸附(0.4至0.45g/升)。在包含1％Pd的催化剂中，吸附的NO2的量随着铜的量增加而降低，但是大部分这些混合的组分催化剂具有高的NOx储存容量，其中Cu负载量小于3.3重量％。然而，具有仅一种包含2.5重量％Cu CHA的组分的对比催化剂7提供最少量的NO2吸附(≤0.01g/升)。结果显示，Pd对于NOx储存功能是重要的。\n在150℃的初始温度储存，然后以10℃/分钟的速率温度上升之后的对比催化剂6和催化剂8、11和12的在TPD期间的NOx释放曲线示于图5中。也使用相同的气体混合物在储存阶段期间但在TPD期间没有任何烃存在下评价催化剂12。\n仅具有包含1重量％Pd CHA的一个层的对比催化剂6提供最大量的NOx释放。所释放的NOx的量随着包含1％Pd的这些催化剂中的铜的量增加而降低，这与在储存阶段储存的NOx的量部分地一致，如图4中所示。看起来在Cu存在下，所释放的NOx的量低于储存量。这可能是由于一些释放的NOx在Cu存在下通过HC-SCR还原。这对于包含2.5％Cu的1％Pd-CHA催化剂得以证实，其也在TPD期间气体混合物中没有烃的情况下评价。在HC不存在下释放明显更多的NOx，在具有或不具有HC的情况下分别具有约220和235ppm的最大浓度。\n也以300L*hr-1*g-1的MHSV在以2升/分钟流动的气体混合物中评价包含1重量％Pd和不同量的Cu的这些经水热老化的催化剂的NH3SCR活性，所述气体混合物包含500ppm NO、500ppm NH3、5％CO2、5％H2O、300ppm CO、200ppm C3H6和12％O2。在气体混合物中将样品温度以5℃/分钟从150℃倾斜升温至550℃。图6显示了温度对具有不同的Cu负载量的催化剂的％NOx转化率的影响。不存在Cu的仅具有Pd的催化剂具有对于SCR反应的低活性。这些催化剂对于通过NH3选择性还原NOx的反应性随着Cu负载量增加并且包含大于1重量％Cu的催化剂显示出高SCR活性。这些结果证实Cu作为活性SCR催化剂的重要性。\n这些测试证实了Cu CHA组分与Pd组分的组合不仅对于在低温的被动NOx吸附是活性的而且对于通过NH3 SCR反应的NOx转化也是活性和选择性的。这样的混合系统的另一有利之处在于，可以将废气中的HC用于NOx转化过程。包含2.5重量％Cu和1重量％Pd的催化剂具有对于NOx的最优的活性并且具有高NH3 SCR活性。\n实施例2.具有固定Cu负载量和不同的Pd地粉末样品\n如实施例2中所描述制备一系列包括含铜和/或钯的铝硅酸盐菱沸石(CHA SAR)的催化剂，其具有2.5重量％铜的固定Cu负载量和示于下表中的在0.2重量％至1重量％之间的不同的钯负载量。如上文所描述的对比催化剂7为包括2.5％Cu CHA的单个层。以下催化剂13-15的每一种具有两种组分，包括2.5％Cu CHA与以下指明的量的Pd。\n\n\n\n\n\n \n具有2.5重量％的固定的Cu的第二组分\n\n\n催化剂13\n0.2重量％Pd\n\n\n催化剂14\n0.5重量％Pd\n\n\n催化剂15\n1.0重量％Pd\n\n\n\n\n\n分析样品的PNA和SCR活性，如上文实施例1所述。图7显示了存在于气体中的NOx随时间变化的量。所述图显示了从约1分钟至约2分钟的NOx的浓度的降低。NOx浓度方面的降低和时间长度的缩短越大，则吸附的NOx的量越高。没有Pd的催化剂具有最少的NOx吸附。包含2.5％Cu的催化剂中的NOx吸附的量随着Pd的量增加而增加。该测试证实了可以通过调节催化剂中的Pd负载量来控制NOx吸附。\n图8显示了温度对吸附的NO2的量的影响(以g/升计)。吸附的NO2的量从100℃至170℃相对恒定。具有0.5％或1％Pd的催化剂上的NO2吸附是相当的，其量为约0.25至0.3g/升。具有0.2％Pd的催化剂提供较少的NO2吸附，其量为约0.1至0.15g/升。具有仅一种包含2.5重量％Cu CHA的组分的对比催化剂7提供最少量的NO2吸附(≤0.01g/升)。结果再次证实Pd作为NOx储存组分的作用。\n也以300L*hr-1*g-1的MHSV在以2升/分钟流动的气体混合物中评价包含2.5重量％Cu和不同量的Pd的这些经水热老化的催化剂的NH3SCR活性，所述气体混合物包含500ppmNO、500ppm NH3、5％CO2、5％H2O、300ppm CO、200ppm C3H6和12％O2。将样品在气体混合物中以5℃/分钟从150℃倾斜升温至550℃。图9显示了温度对具有不同Pd负载量和2.5重量％的固定量的Cu的催化剂的％NOx转化率的影响。这些催化剂显示出高SCR活性，尽管具有1重量％的最高Pd负载量的催化剂显示出在高反应温度时选择性方面的轻微下降。这些结果表明所描述浓度的Pd NOx储存组分可以与Cu SCR催化剂组合而不明显影响其活性和选择性。\n实施例3.涂覆的整料\n制备一系列包括含铜或钯的具有25的SAR的铝硅酸盐菱沸石(CHA)的催化剂。Cu负载量为2.5重量％并且Pd负载量为1重量％。将每种催化剂在500℃煅烧，然后研磨至约5μm的D90。然后将研磨的样品制浆成载体涂料，然后以在下表中对于催化剂3-5所示的载体涂料负载量涂覆在整料基材上，其中Pd CHA作为底层和Cu菱沸石作为顶层。对比催化剂1为包括负载量为2.5重量％的Cu CHA和载体涂料负载量为2.5g/in3的单个层。对比催化剂2为两层催化剂，其具有包括载体涂层负载量为2.5g/in3的Cu CHA的上层和包括负载量为2g/in3的ZnO的下层。\n然后将样品在空气中在500℃煅烧。\n\n\n\n\n\n \n顶层\n底层\n\n\n催化剂3\n2.5g/in<sup>3</sup> Cu CHA\n1.5g/in<sup>3</sup> Pd CHA\n\n\n催化剂4\n1.5g/in<sup>3</sup> Cu CHA\n1.5g/in<sup>3</sup> Pd CHA\n\n\n催化剂5\n1.5g/in<sup>3</sup> Cu CHA\n2.5g/in<sup>3</sup> Pd CHA\n\n\n\n\n\n在150℃和600℃之间如下测量这些催化剂的NH3 SCR活性：使包括500ppm NO、750ppm氨、350ppm CO、10％氧气、8％CO2和5％H2O和剩余为氮气的气体经过所述催化剂(60KSV，ANR 1.5)并测量在暴露至催化剂之前和之后所存在的NOx和氨的量。使用傅里叶变换红外(FTIR)光谱法定量存在于气体中的NOx和氨的量。图10显示了每种催化剂在150℃至600℃的温度的％NOx转化率。所述％NOx转化率对于全部五种催化剂而言是类似的，再次证实Pd底层的存在并不是不利于Cu-沸石催化剂的SCR活性。\n图11显示了CO的％转化率。实施例3-5的催化剂的每一种从约150℃至约600℃提供了高得多的水平的CO转化率。例如在约220℃，实施例3-5的催化剂的每一种提供约50％的CO转化率，而对比实施例1和2提供了小于约2％的转化率。实施例3-5在介于约320℃和400℃之间提供至少90％的CO转化率，而对比实施例1和2在该温度范围内提供仅约10-20％的转化率。\n因此，实施例3-5的催化剂在宽得多的温度范围内提供比使用对比实施例1和2的催化剂所观察的大大增加的CO转化率。\n实施例4–MVEG测试\n将使用2.2L LDD欧5发动机的MVEG测试用于将目前使用的DOC+SCRF系统与使用上文所描述的催化剂制品的SCR/PNA+CSF进行比较。在这些系统中，DOC为标准Pt-Pd催化剂，PGM负载量为80 2:1g/ft3和载体涂层负载量为2.3g/in3，并且SCRF为Cu-CHA催化剂，Cu负载量为88.6g/ft3和载体涂层负载量为1.9g/in3。SCR/PNA系统为类似于上文实施例3的层状催化剂，其中下层PGM负载量为60g/ft3和载体涂层负载量为1.0g/in3和上层Cu负载量为120g/ft3和载体涂层负载量为2.4g/in3。CSF包含负载量为20 10:1g/ft3的Pt-Pd PGM并且具有1.5g/in3的载体涂层负载量。以下几个图显示了在两个位置完成的各种参数的测量：离开发动机(发动机排出)和它们离开催化剂系统特别是SCR/PNA之后或SCRF之后。\n图12显示了在整个测试期间在不同时间的SCR或SCRF之前的温度。SCR/PNA+CSF系统中的SCR/PNA处的温度高于DOC/SCRF系统中的SCRF处的温度。SCR/CSF系统中的SCR处的升高的温度允许与DOC/SCRF系统相比更早的还原剂计量添加。\n图13和14显示了在MVEG测试期间SCRF前和SCR/PNA前的NO2/NOx比例。SCR/PNA系统具有比在DOC+SCRF系统中更高的NO2/NOx比例，特别是在低温在测试循环的第一部分中。这可能是由于将发动机排出的NO2经DOC+SCRF系统中的DOC通过HC或CO还原至NO。\n图15显示了通过SCR/PNA之后和DOC–SCRF之后的两个系统的总烃去除的累积量。在MVEG测试期间，发动机产生约2.2g的THC，其中DOC+Cu SCRF系统排出约(0.25g)的THC并且SCR/PNA系统排出小于约1.3g的THC。如期望地，DOC+SCRF由于DOC的高活性而具有比SCR/PNA更低的HC排放，但是在该实施例中单独的PNA/SCR系统可以去除发动机排出HC的约80％。可以在CSF之后的完整系统上实现HC排放方面的进一步降低。\n图16显示了在任何尿素注入之前在MVEG测试中经第一个250秒通过发动机产生的NOx以及PNA/SCR和DOC+Cu SCRF处理系统之后的NOx排放的累积质量。DOC+Cu SCRF系统对测试循环的冷部分期间产生的NOx的累积质量影响不大。然而，具有Pd沸石下层的PNA/CuSCR系统提供在MVEG测试中经第一个250秒产生的NOx的累积质量方面大于60％减少。图18显示了在250秒之后在具有尿素注入的整个测试循环内的PNA/SCR和DOC+Cu SCRF处理系统之后的NOx排放。\n图17显示了在MVEG运行期间随着时间的具有尿素计量添加的在从发动机释放(发动机排出)之后和在通过(a)DOC加上Cu SCRF；或(b)具有钯小孔沸石下层的铜SCR之后测量的所产生的累积NOx质量(g)。\n图18显示了使用两种不同催化剂系统的氨泄漏的量。使用DOC+SCRF提供了最大浓度为约100ppm的氨泄漏。Cu SCR与Pd小孔沸石下层的组合将氨泄漏的最大量降低至小于5ppm。\n图19显示了PNA/SCR和DOC+Cu SCRF处理系统之后的CO排放的累积质量。PNA/SCR系统可以减少大部分CO排放，但是比DOC+Cu SCRF效率低。在CSF之后的完整系统上可以实现CO排放的进一步减少。\n上述附图证实了本文中所描述的催化剂制品和包含废气制品的废气系统可以在使用2.2L LDD欧5发动机测试时：\n提供以下的两者或更多者：(a)在MVEG测试中经第一个250秒所产生的NOx累积量方面至少50％的降低；(b)在MVEG测试中经第一个1100秒所产生的NOx累积量方面至少50％的降低；(c)在MVEG测试中经1200秒所产生的CO累积量方面提供至少75％的降低；和(d)在MVEG测试中经1200秒所产生的THC累积量方面至少75％的降低；\n提供以下的三者或更多者：(a)在MVEG测试中经第一个250秒所产生的NOx累积量方面至少50％的降低；(b)在MVEG测试中经第一个1100秒所产生的NOx累积量方面至少50％的降低；(c)在MVEG测试中经1200秒所产生的CO累积量方面至少75％的降低；和(d)在MVEG测试中经1200秒所产生的THC累积量方面至少75％的降低；\n提供：(a)在MVEG测试中经第一个250秒所产生的NOx累积量方面至少50％的降低；(b)在MVEG测试中经第一个1100秒所产生的NOx累积量方面至少50％的降低；(c)在MVEG测试中经1200秒所产生的CO累积量方面至少75％的降低；和(d)在MVEG测试中经1200秒所产生的THC累积量方面至少75％的降低；\n提供以下的两者或更多者：(a)在MVEG测试中经第一个250秒累积产生的小于约0.35g的NOx；(b)在MVEG测试中经第一个1100秒累积产生的小于约1.3g的NOx；(c)在MVEG测试中经1200秒累积产生的小于约7.5g的CO；和(d)在MVEG测试中经1200秒累积产生的小于约0.6g的THC；\n提供以下的三者或更多者：(a)在MVEG测试中经第一个250秒累积产生的小于约0.35g的NOx；(b)在MVEG测试中经第一个1100秒累积产生的小于约1.3g的NOx；(c)在MVEG测试中经1200秒累积产生的小于约7.5g的CO；和(d)在MVEG测试中经1200秒累积产生的小于约0.6g的THC；\n提供：(a)在MVEG测试中经第一个250秒累积产生的小于约0.35g的NOx；(b)在MVEG测试中经第一个1100秒累积产生的小于约1.3g的NOx；(c)在MVEG测试中经1200秒累积产生的小于约7.5g的CO；和(d)在MVEG测试中经1200秒累积产生的小于约0.6g的THC；\n转化的NOx、HC和CO的量可以取决于发动机排放条件。\n尽管参考具体实施方案在本文中阐释和描述了本发明，但是将本发明并不意在被限制至所示的细节。相反，在权利要求的等价物的范围和幅度之内在细节上可以进行各种修改并且不脱离本发明。",

顶部层覆盖。该材料为实施例5。通过将实施例5的样品在620℃下在包含10％的H2O的气氛中老化50小时制备经老化的样品。\n图1显示了实施例1-5的在GHSV＝120,000h-1下的NO+NH3反应性能。相比于实施例1和2，实施例3、4和5显著减少了N2O形成，在200-300℃，N2O减少最高为85％。实施例3、4和5中NO转化率和N2收率也显著更高。这些结果说明在实施例3、4和5中，Cu上的 SCR反应得到促进并且Pt上的非选择性NH3+NO反应(主要产物为 N2O)并且伴生的Pt上的NH3氧化(其减少了Cu上的SCR反应可得的 NH3)得到最小化。尽管实施例2、4和5包含相同量的Cu-SCR催化剂，在实施例4和5中，N2O的形成低得多并且NO转化率高得多。这些结果表明沸石载Pt+Cu-SCR共混物底部层组合物对减少的N2O 形成减少和改善的N2选择性负主要责任，而通过简单地增加顶部层中的Cu-SCR的量可以实现的益处极少。\n图2显示了实施例1、3和5中在GHSV＝60,000h-1下具有不同 ANR(氨与NO比例)的NO+NH3反应性能。将ANR从1.0增加至1.4 改善了全部催化剂中的NO转化率，表明对于优化的NOx去除效率， ANR>1是期望的。在1.4的高ANR(即，没有足够NO来与全部NH3反应，导致来自Cu-SCR组分的NH3逸出)下，全部三个催化剂测试显示在250℃以上几乎没有NH3逸出。因为在全部三种催化剂中对NH3氧化具有高度活性的Pt的存在，这是预期的。然而，在实施例3和5中，在250℃下，NO转化率高了约10％并且N2O形成低了75％。实施例3和5证明了在NOx和NH3都存在于进料中时Cu-催化的SCR 反应得到促进并且Pt-催化的非选择性NO+NH3反应得到最小化。\n系统的比较：\n系统 组合物\n1) 100％的Cu-SCR上游(SV＝75,000h-1)+实施例1下游(SV＝120,000h-1)\n2) 50％的Cu-SCR上游(SV＝150,000h-1)+实施例1下游(SV＝120,000h-1)\n3) 100％的Cu-SCR上游(SV＝75,000h-1)+实施例5下游(SV＝120,000h-1)\n4) 50％的Cu-SCR上游(SV＝150,000h-1)+实施例5下游(SV＝120,000h-1)\n图3显示了具有在上游中各种体积的Cu-SCR催化剂和Cu-SCR 下游的实施例1和5的系统上的NO+NH3反应性能。\n系统1与系统3的比较：\n两个系统在前部具有相同的完全尺寸的SCR，具有足以完全地除去300ppm NO+300ppm NH3的体积。后部ASC催化剂仅仅对氧化 200ppm的未反应的NH3负责。如预期的，在NO和NH3转化率上，两个系统之间区别极小。然而，系统3中N2O形成低得多，其中实施例5为下游(作为ASC催化剂)，这归因于其N2O形成更低。\n系统2与系统4的比较：\n两个系统在前部具有相同的半尺寸的SCR，具有不足以完全除去 300ppm NO的体积，导致NO和NH3逸出。在实施例1下游的情况下，由于前SCR体积减小，NO转化率显著降低并且N2O形成显著增加，表示Pt上发生NH3氧化和非选择性NH3+NO反应。相反，在实施例5下游的情况下，NO转化率没有明显的降低并且N2O形成几乎没有增加，表明Pt上的非选择性NH3+NO反应得到最小化。\n前述实施例仅仅意图作为展示；所附权利要求限定了本发明的范围。",

(二氧化氮)，并且NO占形成的NOx的主要部分。已知NOx引起人们的许多健康问题，以及引起许多有害的环境效应，包括形成烟雾和酸雨。为了减轻来自于废气中的NOx对于人和环境的影响，令人期望的是消除这些不期望的组分，优选通过不产生其他有害或有毒物质的方法。\n贫燃和柴油发动机产生的废气通常是氧化性的。NOx需要在被称作选择性催化还原(SCR)的方法中用催化剂和还原剂选择性还原，该方法将NOx转化成单质氮(N2)和水。在SCR方法中，将气态还原剂，典型地是无水氨、氨水或尿素添加到废气流中，然后使该废气接触催化剂。还原剂吸收到催化剂上，并且在气体经过催化型基底之中或之上时还原NOx。为了使NOx的转化率最大，经常必需向气流中添加大于化学计量量的氨。但是，过量的氨释放到大气中将对人的健康和对环境有害。另外，氨是苛性的，特别是它的含水形式。排气催化剂下游的排气管线区域中氨和水的冷凝会产生腐蚀性混合物，其会损坏排气系统。所以，应当消除废气中氨的释放。在许多常规排气系统中，氨氧化催化剂(也被称作氨泄漏催化剂或“ASC”)安装在SCR催化剂下游，来通过将氨转化成氮来从废气中除去氨。使用氨泄漏催化剂会使得典型的柴油机驱动循环中NOx转化率大于90％。\n令人期望的是拥有提供通过SCR除去NOx和将氨选择性转化成氮二者的催化剂，其中氨转化在车辆驾驶循环中的宽温度范围进行，并且形成最少的氧化氮和一氧化二氮副产物。\n\n\n发明内容\n在第一方面中，本发明涉及一种催化剂，其包含氨储存性低的载体上的铂，和第一SCR催化剂，优选Cu-SCR催化剂或Fe-SCR催化剂的组合。氨储存性低的载体可以是含硅载体。含硅载体可以包括二氧化硅或二氧化硅与氧化铝之比是至少100的沸石。铂在氨储存性低的载体上的组合是，(1)氨储存性低的载体上的铂与第一SCR催化剂的共混物，或者(2)双层，其具有包含第一SCR催化剂的顶层和包含氨储存性低的载体上的铂的底层，其中底层位于基底上或第三SCR催化剂(其位于底层和第三SCR催化剂之间)上。催化剂可以进一步包括第二SCR催化剂，其中第二SCR催化剂与氨储存性低的载体上的铂与第一SCR催化剂的共混物相邻布置，并且第二SCR催化剂至少部分地叠覆氨储存性低的载体上的铂与第一SCR催化剂的共混物。催化剂可以进一步包含第三SCR催化剂，其中第三SCR催化剂与氨储存性低的载体上的铂与第一SCR催化剂的共混物相邻布置，并且氨储存性低的载体上的铂与第一SCR催化剂的共混物至少部分地叠覆第三 SCR催化剂。与包含相当的配方的催化剂相比，该催化剂可以提高在约250℃-约350℃的温度由氨到N2的产率，在所述包含相当的配方的催化剂中，第一SCR催化剂作为第一层存在，负载的铂存在于第二层中，并且包含NH3的气体经过第一层，然后经过第二层。\n在另一方面中，本发明涉及制造包含氨储存性低的载体上的铂与第一SCR催化剂的共混物的催化剂的方法，其中第一SCR催化剂优选是Cu-SCR催化剂或Fe-SCR催化剂。\n在又一方面中，本发明涉及制品，其包含：包含氨储存性低的载体上的铂与第一SCR催化剂的共混物的催化剂，其中第一SCR催化剂优选是Cu-SCR催化剂或Fe-SCR催化剂，和这些制品在约250℃-

SCR的第三层位于第二层上面且覆盖整个负载的铂层。\n\n\n具体实施方式\n作为本说明书和附加的权利要求书中所用的，单数形式“一个”、“一种”和“该”包括复数指代物，除非上下文另有明确指示。因此，例如提及“一种催化剂”时包括两种或更多种催化剂的混合物等。\n作为本文使用的，术语“氨泄漏”表示经过SCR催化剂的未反应的氨的量。\n术语“载体”表示催化剂固定到的材料。\n术语“氨储存性低的载体”典型地表示每m3载体储存小于

"Description\n\n农业上有利的微生物、微生物组合物以及聚生体\n\n相关申请案的交叉引用\n\n本申请是PCT国际专利申请，其要求2015年2月09日提交的美国临时专利申请第62/113,792号和2015年5月22日提交的美国临时专利申请第62/165,620号以及2016年1月19日提交的美国临时专利申请第62/280,503号的优先权，其皆以全文引用的方式并入本文中以用于所有目的。\n\n技术领域\n本发明涉及尤其在农业中具有应用的经分离的和生物学上纯的微生物。所公开的微生物可以其经分离的和生物学上纯的状态使用，也可以配制成农业上可接受的组合物。此外，本公开提供农业上有利的微生物聚生体，其含有所公开的微生物中的至少两个成员，以及在农业应用中使用所述聚生体的方法。\n\n\n背景技术\n根据联合国世界粮食计划署(United Nations World Food Program)，全世界有将近9亿营养不良人口。营养不良流行病在全世界发展中国家尤其显著，其中六名儿童中便有一名体重偏轻。缺乏可用的食物可归因于多种社会经济因素；然而，无论最终起因如何，事实仍然是可用于喂养正在增长的世界人口的食物不足，预期世界人口在2050年将达到90亿人。联合国估算到2050年，农业产量必须增加70-100％以喂养所计划的全球人口。\n这些惊人的世界人口和营养不良数字突出了农业功效和生产力在维持正在增长的全世界人口方面的重要性。通过现代中耕作物农业实现的技术进步(其引起以前从未见过的作物产量)令人印象深刻。然而，尽管通过技术创新取得进步，如经遗传工程改造的作物和新型杀害虫和除草化合物，但仍需要经改良的作物性能，以满足以指数方式增加的全世界人口的需求。\n科学家估算如果可以缩小全世界农业“产量差”(其为所观察到的最佳产量与在其它地方的结果之间的差)，那么全世界作物生产量将上升45-70％。也就是说，如果所有农民(与全世界位置无关)可以实现关于其各别区域所预期的最高的可达到的产量，那么可解决全世界食物生产量方面的大部分不足。然而，在不同的世界地貌中解决如何实现更高的产量的问题是困难的。\n通常，产量差可通过水不足、不标准的耕种操作、肥料不足以及无法使用除草剂和农药来说明。然而，在全世界范围内极大地增加水、肥料、除草剂以及农药的使用不仅对于全世界大部分地区来说是经济上不可行的，而且将造成不良的环境后果。\n因此，通过大部分发达国家所使用的简单地按比例增加当前高输入型农业系统来满足全球农业产量期望是完全不可行的。\n因此，在所属领域中迫切需要经改良的用于提高作物性能和赋予所需植物物种有利的特性的方法。\n\n\n发明内容\n本发明解决如何改良作物性能的这一重要问题，由此缩小全世界产量差，并且提供赋予植物物种其它有利特性的方法。\n由本发明提供的用于提高作物性能和增加产量的解决方案对地球资源无害，因为其不依赖于增加耗水量或增加系统中合成化学物质的输入。实际上，本发明利用微生物来赋予所需植物有利的特性，包括提高产率。\n因此，本公开提供可使农民提高重要作物的产量的环境上可持续的解决方案，其不依赖于增加合成除草剂和农药的使用。\n在实施例中，本公开提供有效并且广泛适用的农业平台，其利用可促进一种或多种所需植物特性的微生物和微生物聚生体。\n在一些实施例中，利用单一微生物。在一些方面中，所述单一微生物经分离和纯化。在一些方面中，单一微生物是细菌的分类物种。在一些方面中，单一微生物是细菌的分类物种的可鉴别品系。在一些方面中，单一微生物是新型、最近发现的细菌的分类物种的品系。\n在一些实施例中，利用来自表1的单一微生物。在其它实施例中，利用来自表2的单一微生物。在其它实施例中，利用来自表3的单一微生物。\n在一些实施例中，使用来自芽生杆菌属(genus Bosea)的微生物。\n在一些方面中，所述单一微生物(无论分类学上可鉴别的物种或品系)与不同物种或品系的一种或多种其它微生物组合。在某些方面中，两种或更多种微生物的组合形成聚生体或联合体。术语聚生体和联合体可互换地使用。\n在某些方面中，本公开提供高功能性微生物聚生体的研究，所述微生物聚生体有助于促进所需表现型或基因型植物特性的研究和表现。在一些实施例中，本发明的聚生体具有当个别微生物单独存在时未在自然界中发现的功能属性。也就是说，在多种实施例中，将具体微生物物种组合成聚生体可产生具有功能属性的微生物组合，所述功能属性是在单独考虑时，所述聚生体中的任何一个个别成员都不具有的。\n在一些实施例中，微生物聚生体所具有的这种功能属性是赋予植物物种一种或多种有利特性的能力，例如：增加生长、提高产量、提高氮利用效率、提高耐胁迫性、提高耐旱性、提高光合率、增强水使用效率、提高抗病原体性、未必影响植物产量，但实际上解决植物功能性的对植物架构的修改等。\n在一些实施例中，个别微生物在其存在于自然界中时不具有可赋予植物这些有利特性的能力。实际上，在一些实施例中，通过人力将这些微生物组合成可产生功能组合物的聚生体，所述功能组合物具有自然界中不存在的属性和功能特性。\n然而，在其它实施例中，本公开提供个别经分离和生物学上纯的微生物，其能够赋予所需植物物种有利特性而无需将所述微生物组合成聚生体。\n在实施例中，微生物聚生体可以是来自表1的个别微生物的任何组合。在其它实施例中，微生物聚生体可以是来自表2的个别微生物的任何组合。在其它实施例中，微生物聚生体可以是来自表3的个别微生物的任何组合。在其它实施例中，微生物聚生体可以是来自表1到3中任一个的个别微生物的任何组合。在某些实施例中，微生物聚生体包含两种微生物，或三种微生物，或四种微生物，或五种微生物，或六种微生物，或七种微生物，或八种微生物，或九种微生物，或10种微生物，或超过10种微生物。\n本公开的另一个目标涉及使用经分离的微生物和微生物聚生体作为植物生长促进剂。在其它方面中，经分离的微生物和微生物聚生体充当生长调节剂，其可例如抵抗正常老化从而引起生物质量增加。\n本公开的另一目标涉及使用经分离的微生物和微生物聚生体作为土壤健康增强剂和植物健康增强剂。\n本公开的另一目标是设计微生物联合体，其能够共同实现多维活性。在某些方面中，包含联合体的微生物以协同方式起作用。在各方面中，微生物联合体对某一植物特征的作用将大于所述联合体中任何一个个别微生物成员在单独使用时所观察到的作用。也就是说，在一些方面中，与联合体中的任何个别成员在单独使用时发现的作用相比，联合体对所需植物特征呈现大于累加作用的作用。\n在一些方面中，聚生体引起产生其它植物-微生物相互作用，例如通过充当可设定未来微生物群落发育轨迹的主要定殖体或产生群体。\n在实施例中，本公开涉及微生物分离物的协同组合(或混合物)。\n在一些方面中，本文中教示的聚生体提供广泛范围的农业应用，包括：改良谷物、果实和花朵产量；改良植物部分的生长；改良抗病性；改良在极端气候中的存活率；以及改良其它所需植物表现型特征。显然，对植物的这些益处可在对环境无任何有害副作用的情况下获得。\n在一些方面中，本公开的个别微生物或包含其的聚生体可组合成农业上可接受的组合物。\n在一些实施例中，本公开的农业组合物包括(但不限于)：润湿剂、相容剂、消泡剂、清洗剂、螯合剂、防飘移剂、中和剂、缓冲剂、腐蚀抑制剂、染料、气味剂、扩展剂、渗透助剂、粘着剂、结合剂、分散剂、增稠剂、稳定剂、乳化剂、冷冻点抑制剂、抗菌剂、肥料、农药、除草剂、惰性载剂、聚合物等。\n在本公开的一个实施例中，以种子涂料或其它种子施用物形式供应微生物(包括经分离的单一物种，或品系，或聚生体)。在实施例中，种子涂料可施用于裸的和未经处理的种子。在其它实施例中，种子涂料可用作经预先处理的种子的种子外涂层。\n在一些实施例中，所施用的可变成内生性并且因此将存在于所处理的生长植物和其后代中。在其它实施例中，微生物可与种子处理同时以共同处理形式施用。\n在本公开的一个实施例中，微生物以颗粒，或插入物，或施用于植物生长培养基的土壤浇灌物形式供应。在其它实施例中，微生物以叶面施用物形式供应，如叶面喷雾或液体组合物。叶面喷雾或液体施用物可施用于生长植物或生长培养基，例如土壤。\n在实施例中，本公开的农业组合物可尤其配制成：(1)溶液；(2)可湿性粉末；(3)粉尘；(4)可溶性粉末；(5)乳液或悬浮液浓缩物；(6)拌种；(7)片剂；(8)水分散性颗粒；(9)水溶性颗粒(缓慢或快速释放)；(10)微囊封颗粒或悬浮液；以及(11)灌溉组分。在某些方面中，在常规喷雾施用之前，组合物可在水性介质中稀释。本公开的组合物可施用于土壤、植物、种子、根围、根鞘或其它可有利地施用微生物组合物的区域。\n本公开的另一目标涉及农业组合物，其经配制以提供高集落形成单位(CFU)细菌群体或聚生体。在一些方面中，农业组合物具有可实现相关存放期的佐剂。在实施例中，所教示的农业组合物的CFU浓度高于在所公开的方法之外，所述微生物将天然存在的浓度。在另一实施例中，农业组合物以103-1012CFU/克载剂或105-109CFU/克载剂的浓度含有微生物细胞。在一个方面中，微生物细胞以种子涂层形式，以105-109CFU的浓度直接施用于种子。在其它方面中，微生物细胞以另一种皮顶部上的种子外涂层形式，以105-109CFU的浓度施用。在其它方面中，微生物细胞与另一种种子处理剂一起以共同处理形式，以105-109CFU的浓度施用。\n在各方面中，本公开涉及可促进植物生长的农业微生物配制物。在各方面中，本公开提供所教示的经分离的微生物，和包含其的聚生体，其待配制成农业生物接种体。所教示的生物接种体可施用于植物、种子或土壤。配制包含经分离的微生物的生物接种体的适合的实例可见于美国专利案第7,097,830号中，其以引用的方式并入本文中。\n所公开的多微生物配制物可：降低对含氮肥料的需要、使矿物质溶解、保护植物抵抗病原体以及使植物可获得有价值的营养物，如磷酸盐，由此降低或消除对使用化学农药和化学肥料的需要。\n在一些实施例中，在赋予所需植物物种一种或多种有利的性质或特性的方法中，可使用本公开的经分离和生物学上纯的微生物。\n在一些实施例中，在赋予所需植物物种一种或多种有利的性质或特性的方法中，可使用含有本公开的经分离和生物学上纯的微生物的农业上可接受的组合物。\n在一些实施例中，在赋予所需植物物种一种或多种有利的性质或特性的方法中，可使用本公开的聚生体。\n在一些实施例中，在赋予所需植物物种一种或多种有利的性质或特性的方法中，可使用含有本公开的聚生体的农业上可接受的组合物。\n在一些方面中，本公开的经分离和生物学上纯的微生物和/或本公开的聚生体是来源于加速微生物选择过程(“AMS”过程)。在本公开的一些方面中使用的AMS描述于例如以下文献中：(1)2012年9月20日公开为国际公开案第WO

156(1958年第4期)(讨论由微生物产生的维生素B12的纯度界限)，其以引用的方式并入本文中。\n如本文中所使用，“个别分离物”应视为指在与一种或多种其它微生物分离之后，主要包含微生物的单一属、物种或品系的组合物或培养物。片语不应视为指示微生物的分离或纯化程度。然而，“个别分离物”可基本上仅包含微生物的一种属、物种或品系。\n如本文中所使用，术语“生长培养基”是任何适合于支持植物生长的培养基。作为实例，培养基可以是天然或人造的，包括(但不限于)：土壤、盆栽混合土、树皮、蛭石、单独的并且施用于固体植物支持系统的水耕溶液以及组织培养凝胶。应了解，培养基可单独使用或与一种或多种其它培养基组合使用。其还可以在添加或不添加用于根和叶子的外源营养物和物理支持系统的情况下使用。\n在一个实施例中，生长培养基是天然存在的培养基，如土壤、砂、泥浆、粘土、腐殖质、表土、岩石或水。在另一实施例中，生长培养基是人造的。这类人造的生长培养基可构筑成模拟天然存在的培养基的条件；然而，这并非必需的。人造的生长培养基可由任何数目的材料中的一种或多种和其组合制成，包括砂、矿物质、玻璃、岩石、水、金属、盐、营养物、水。在一个实施例中，生长培养基是无菌的。在另一实施例中，生长培养基不是无菌的。\n培养基可被改善或富含其它化合物或组分，例如可有助于微生物与植物的特定群体以及彼此的相互相用和/或选择的组分。举例来说，可存在抗生素(如青霉素)或灭菌剂(例如季铵盐和氧化剂)和/或可改善生理条件(如盐度、植物营养物(例如有机和无机矿物质(如磷、氮盐、氨、钾和微量养分，如钴和镁)、pH值和/或温度)。\n如本文中所使用，术语“植物”包括完整植物或其任何部分或衍生物，如植物细胞、植物原生质体、可使植物再生的植物细胞组织培养物、植物愈伤组织、胚芽、花粉、胚珠、果实、花朵、叶子、种子、根根端等。\n如本文所使用，术语“栽培品种”是指已通过园艺或农艺技术产生并且通常不发现于野生型群体中的植物品种、品系或族类。\n如本文中所使用，术语“双子叶植物(dicotyledon/dicot)”和“双子叶”是指具有胚芽的开花植物，所述胚芽含有两个子叶。如本文中所使用，术语“单子叶植物(monocotyledon/monocot)”和“单子叶”是指具有仅含有一个子叶的胚芽的开花植物。这些群组之间当然存在其它已知的差异，其将由所属领域的技术人员容易地识别。\n如本文中所使用，“经改良”应广泛地用于涵盖与对照植物相比，或与所讨论的特征相关联的已知平均数量相比，植物的特征的改良。举例来说，与施用本公开的有益微生物或聚生体相关联的“经改良”植物生物质量可通过比较由本文中教示的微生物处理的植物的生物质量与未经处理的对照植物的生物质量来证明。或者，可以比较由本文中教示的微生物处理的植物的生物质量与既定植物通常达到的平均生物质量(如所属领域的技术人员已知的科学或农业出版物中表示)。在本公开中，“经改良”未必需要资料是统计显著的(即p<0.05)；实际上，任何表明一个值(例如平均处理值)与另一个值(例如平均对照值)的可定量差异可上升到“经改良”的程度。\n如本文中所使用，“抑制和抑止”和类似术语不应解释为需要完全抑制或抑止，但在一些实施例中可能需要这种作用。\n如本文中所使用，术语“基因型”是指个别细胞、细胞培养物、组织、生物体(例如植物)或生物体群组的基因组成。\n如本文中所使用，术语“等位基因”意指基因的一种或多种替代形式中的任一种，其中所有等位基因涉及至少一种特性或特征。在二倍体细胞中，既定基因的两个等位基因占据一对同源染色体上的相应基因座。在实施例中，因为本公开涉及QTL，即可包含一种或多种基因或调节序列的基因组区域，在一些情况下，称为“单倍型”(即染色体区段的等位基因)比“等位基因”更准确，然而，在那些实例中，术语“等位基因”应理解为包含术语“单倍型”。等位基因在其表达类似表现型时被视为一致。序列中可能存在差异，但并不重要，只要其不影响表现型即可。\n如本文中所使用，术语“基因座(locus)”(基因座(loci)的复数形式)意指可发现例如基因或基因标记物的染色体上的特定位置或位点。\n如本文中所使用，术语“以基因方式连接”是指在育种期间，两种或更多种特性以高比率共同遗传，使得其难以通过杂交来分离。\n如本文所使用，“重组”或“重组事件”是指染色体交叉或独立分类。术语“重组”是指具有作为重组事件的结果产生的新基因组成的植物。\n如本文中所使用，术语“分子标记物”或“基因标记物”是指在用于观察核酸序列特征中的差异的方法中使用的指示物。这类指示物的实例是限制性片段长度多形现象(RFLP)标记物、经扩增的片段长度多形现象(AFLP)标记物、单核苷酸多态性(SNP)、插入突变、微卫星标记物(SSR)、经序列表征的扩增区域(SCAR)、经裂解的扩增多晶序列(CAPS)标记物或同工酶标记物或本文中所描述的标记物的组合(其定义特定基因和染色体位置)。等位基因附近分子标记物的定位是可由有分子生物技术经验的普通人执行的程序。\n如本文中所使用，术语“特性”是指特征或表现型。举例来说，在本公开的一些实施例的情形下，作物产量涉及由植物产生的可销售生物质量(例如果实、纤维、谷物)的量。所需特性还可以包括其它植物特征，包括(但不限于)：水使用效率、营养物使用效率、生产率、机械收割能力、果实成熟期、存放期、抗虫性/抗病性、早期植物成熟期、耐胁迫性等。特性可以显性或隐性方式，或以部分或不完全显性方式遗传。特性可以是单基因性(即由单个基因座决定)或多基因性(即由超过一个基因座决定)或也可以由一种或多种基因与环境的相互相用产生。\n显性特性引起在异型接合或同型接合状态下的完全表现型表现；隐性特性仅当在同型接合状态下存在时显示本身。\n在本公开的情形下，特性也可以由一种或多种植物基因与一种或多种微生物基因的相互相用产生。\n如本文中所使用，术语“同型接合”意指当两个一致的等位基因驻存在特定基因座，但个别地安置在二倍生物体的细胞中的相应同源染色体对上时存在的基因条件。相反，如本文中所使用，术语“异型接合”意指当两个不同等位基因驻存在特定基因座，但个别地安置在二倍生物体的细胞中的相应同源染色体对上时存在的基因条件。\n如本文中所使用术语“表现型”是指个别细胞、细胞培养物、生物体(例如植物)或生物体群体的可观察的特征，其由个体的基因组成(即基因型)与环境之间的相互相用产生。\n如本文中所使用，当描述核酸序列或蛋白质序列时，术语“嵌合”或“重组”是指将至少两个异源聚核苷酸或两个异源多肽连接成单个大分子，或使至少一个天然核酸或蛋白质序列的一个或多个元件重新排列的核酸或蛋白质序列。举例来说，术语“重组”可指序列中两个以其它方式分离的区段的人造组合，例如通过化学合成或通过遗传工程改造技术操作核酸中经分离的区段。\n如本文中所使用，“合成核苷酸序列”或“合成多核苷酸序列”是已知在自然界中不存在或不是天然存在的核苷酸序列。通常，当与任何其它天然存在的核苷酸序列相比时，这类合成核苷酸序列将包含至少一种核苷酸差异。\n如本文中所使用，术语“核酸”是指具有任何长度的核苷酸(核糖核苷酸或脱氧核糖核苷酸)的聚合形式，或其类似物。这一术语是指分子的初始结构，并且因此包括双股和单股DNA，以及双股和单股RNA。其还包括经修饰的核酸，如甲基化和/或封端核酸、含有经修饰的碱基、主链修饰的核酸等。术语“核酸”和“核苷酸序列”可互换地使用。\n如本文中所使用，术语“基因”是指与生物功能相关联的任何DNA区段。因此，基因包括(但不限于)编码序列和/或其表达所需的调节序列。基因还可以包括未表达的DNA区段，其例如形成其它蛋白质的识别序列。基因可从多种来源获得，包括从相关来源克隆或从已知或预测的序列信息合成，并且可包括设计成具有所需参数的序列。\n如本文中所使用，术语“同源”或“同源物”或“直系同源物”是所属领域中已知的并且是指共有共同的祖先或家族成员并且基于序列一致性程度测定的相关序列。术语“同源性”、“同源”、“大体上类似”和“基本上对应”在本文中可互换地使用。其是指其中在一个或多个核苷酸碱基中的变化不影响核酸片段介导基因表达或产生某一表现型的能力的核酸片段。这些术语也指本发明的核酸片段的修饰，如一个或多个与初始、未经修饰的片段相比不显著改变所得核酸片段的功能特性的核苷酸的缺失或插入。因此，应理解，如所属领域的技术人员将了解，本公开涵盖超过特定例示性序列。这些术语描述在一种物种、亚种、变种、栽培品种或品系中发现的基因与另一种物种、亚种、变种、栽培品种或品系中的相应或等效基因之间的关系。在本公开中，比较同源序列。认为、相信或已知“同源序列”或“同源物”或“直系同源物”是功能相关的。功能关系可以多种方式中的任一种表示，包括(但不限于)：(a)序列一致性程度和/或(b)相同或类似的生物功能。优选的是，指示(a)和(b)。同源性可使用所属领域中容易获得的软件程序测定，如《最新分子生物学实验方法汇编(CurrentProtocols in Molecular Biology)》(F.M.Ausubel等人编,1987)增刊30,章节7.718,表7.71中讨论的软件程序。一些比对程序是MacVector(Oxford Molecular Ltd，英国牛津布(Oxford,U.K.))、ALIGN Plus(Scientific and Educational Software，宾夕法尼亚州(Pennsylvania))以及AlignX(Vector NTI，Invitrogen，加利福尼亚州卡尔斯巴德(Carlsbad,CA))。另一种比对程序是Sequencher(Gene Codes，密歇根安娜堡(Ann Arbor,Michigan))，其使用默认参数。\n如本文中所使用，术语“核苷酸变化”是指例如核苷酸取代、缺失和/或插入，如在所属领域中良好理解。举例来说，突变含有可产生沉默取代、添加或缺失，但不改变所编码的蛋白质的特性或活性或如何制得蛋白质的变化。\n如本文中所使用，术语“蛋白质修饰”是指例如氨基酸取代、氨基酸修饰、缺失和/或插入，如在所属领域中良好理解。\n如本文中所使用，术语核酸或多肽的“至少一部分”或“片段”意指具有这类序列的最小尺寸特征的部分，或全长分子任何更大的片段，最多是并且包括全长分子。本公开的聚核苷酸的片段可编码基因调节元件的生物活性部分。基因调节元件的生物活性部分可通过分离本公开的一种聚核苷酸中包含基因调节元件的部分并且如本文中所描述评估活性来制备。类似地，多肽的一部分可以是4个氨基酸、5个氨基酸、6个氨基酸、7个氨基酸等，最多是全长多肽。待使用的部分的长度将取决于具体应用。适用作杂交探针的核酸部分可短到12个核苷酸；在一些实施例中，其是20个核苷酸。适用作抗原决定基的多肽部分可短到4个氨基酸。多肽中发挥全长多肽功能的部分将通常长于4个氨基酸。\n变异型聚核苷酸还涵盖来源于突变诱发和诱重组程序(如DNA改组)的序列。这类DNA改组的策略是所属领域中已知的。参见例如Stemmer(1994)《美国国家科学院院刊(PNAS)》91:10747-10751；Stemmer(1994)《自然(Nature)》370:389-391；Crameri等人(1997)《自然生物技术(Nature Biotech.)》15:436-438；Moore等人(1997)《分子生物学杂志(J.Mol.Biol.)》272:336-347；Zhang等人(1997)《美国国家科学院院刊》94:4504-4509；Crameri等人(1998)《自然》391:288-291；以及美国专利第5,605,793号和第5,837,458号。对于本文公开的聚核苷酸的PCR扩增，寡核苷酸引物可设计成用于PCR反应以由从任何相关植物提取的cDNA或基因组DNA扩增相应的DNA序列。用于设计PCR引物和PCR克隆的方法是所属领域中通常已知的并且公开于Sambrook等人(1989)《分子克隆实验指南(MolecularCloning:A Laboratory Manual)》(第2版，Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press，纽约普莱恩维尤(Plainview,New York))。还参见Innis等人编(1990)《PCR方案：方法和应用指导(PCR Protocols:A Guide to Methods and Applications)》(Academic Press，纽约)；Innis和Gelfand编(1995)《PCR策略(PCR Strategies)》(Academic Press，纽约)；以及Innis和Gelfand编(1999)《PCR方法手册(PCR Methods Manual)》(Academic Press，纽约)。已知的PCR方法包括(但不限于)使用成对引物、巢式引物、单一特异性引物、简并引物、基因特异性引物、载体特异性引物、部分不匹配引物等的方法。\n如本文所使用，术语“引物”是指能够粘接到允许DNA聚合酶连接的扩增目标的寡核苷酸，从而在处于诱导引物延伸产物合成的条件下(即在核苷酸和用于聚合的试剂(如DNA聚合酶)存在下和在适合的温度和pH值下)充当DNA合成的起始点。(扩增)引物优选是单股以获得扩增中的最大功效。优选的是，引物是寡脱氧核苷酸。引物必须足够长以在用于聚合的试剂存在下引发延伸产物的合成。引物的精确长度将取决于多种因素，包括引物的温度和组成(A/T对比G/C含量)。一对双向引子由一个正向和一个反向引物组成，如在DNA扩增(如PCR扩增)领域中通常使用。\n术语“严格度”或“严格杂交条件”是指影响杂交物的稳定性的杂交条件，例如温度、盐浓度、pH值、甲酰胺浓度等。这些条件可凭经验最佳化以最大化特异性结合和最小化引物或探针与其目标核酸序列的非特异性结合。所使用的术语包括提及探针或引物将与其目标序列杂交的条件，达到与其它序列相比可检测地更大的程度(例如比背景大至少2倍)。严格条件具有序列依赖性并且将在不同情形下不同。更长序列在更高温度下特异性地杂交。通常，选择严格条件比既定离子强度和pH值下的特异性序列的热熔点(Tm)低约5℃。Tm是使50％的互补目标序列与完全匹配的探针或引物杂交的温度(在既定离子强度和pH值下)。通常，严格条件将是其中在pH 7.0到8.3下盐浓度小于约1.0MNa+离子，通常是约0.01到1.0M Na+离子浓度(或其它盐)，并且温度是至少约30℃(对于短探针或引子(例如10到50个核苷酸))和至少约60℃(对于长探针或引子(例如大于50个核苷酸))的条件。严格条件也可以用添加去稳定化剂(如甲酰胺)来实现。例示性低严格度条件或“降低的严格度的条件”包括在37℃下与具有30％甲酰胺、1M NaCl、1％SDS的缓冲溶液杂交并且在40℃下，在2×SSC中洗涤。例示性高严格度条件包括在37℃下，在50％甲酰胺、1M NaCl、1％SDS中杂交，并且在60℃下，在0.1×SSC中洗涤。杂交程序是所属领域中是众所周知的并且由例如Ausubel等人,1998和Sambrook等人,2001描述。在一些实施例中，严格条件是在45℃下，在含有1mMNa2EDTA、0.5-20％十二烷基硫酸钠的0.25M Na2HPO4缓冲液(pH 7.2)杂交，如0.5％、1％、2％、3％、4％、5％、6％、7％、8％、9％、10％、11％、12％、13％、14％、15％、16％、17％、18％、19％或20％，接着在55℃到65℃下，在含有0.1％(w/v)十二烷基硫酸钠的5×SSC中洗涤。\n如本文中所使用，“启动子”是指能够控制编码序列或功能性RNA的表达的DNA序列。启动子序列由接近和更靠近末端的上游元件组成，后一种元件通常称为强化子。因此，“强化子”是可以刺激启动子活性的DNA序列，并且可以是启动子的固有元件或被插入以增强启动子的含量或组织特异性的异源元件。启动子可完全来源于原生基因，或由来源于在自然界中发现的不同启动子的不同元件组成，或甚至包含合成DNA区段。所属领域的技术人员应理解，不同启动子可引导不同组织或细胞类型中基因的表达，或处于不同发育阶段，或响应不同的环境条件。还认识到，因为在大多数情况下，未完全界定调节序列的准确边界，一些变异形式的DNA片段可具有一致的启动子活性。\n如本文中所使用，“植物启动子”是能够引发植物细胞中的转录的启动子，无论其来源是否是植物细胞，例如众所周知的是农杆菌属(Agrobacterium)启动子在植物细胞中具有功能性。因此，植物启动子包括从植物、植物病毒和细菌(如农杆菌属和短根瘤菌属(Bradyrhizobium)细菌)获得的启动子DNA。植物启动子可以是组成性启动子或非组成性启动子。\n如本文中所使用，“组成性启动子”是在大部分条件下和/或在大部分发展阶段期间具有活性的启动子。在用于植物生物技术的表达载体中使用组成性启动子存在若干优势，如：用于选择转基因细胞或植物的蛋白质的高生产水准；报告蛋白质或评估标记物的高表达水准，使得易于检测和定量；作为调节转录系统的一部分的转录因子的高生产水准；生产在植物中需要普遍存在的活性的化合物；和生产在植物发育的所有阶段期间所需的化合物。非限制性例示性组成性启动子包括CaMV 35S启动子、冠瘿碱启动子、泛素启动子、醇脱氢酶启动子等。\n如本文中所使用，“非组成性启动子”是在某些条件下、在某些类型的细胞中和/或在某些发育阶段期间具有活性的启动子。举例来说，组织特异性、组织优先、细胞类型特异性、细胞类型优先、诱导型启动子和在发育控制下为非组成性启动子的启动子。在发育控制下的启动子的实例包括优先起始在某些组织，如茎、叶子、根或种子中的转录的启动子。\n如本文中所使用，“诱导型”或“阻抑型”启动子是在化学或环境因素控制下的启动子。可能影响通过诱导型启动子的转录的环境条件的实例包括厌氧条件或某些化学物质或存在光。\n如本文中所使用，“组织特异性”启动子是仅仅在某些组织中起始转录的启动子。不同于基因的组成性表达，组织特异性表达是若干相互作用水准的基因调节的结果。因此，在所属领域中，有时优选的是使用来自同源或紧密相关植物物种的启动子以实现转基因在具体组织中的有效和可靠表达。这是大量从具体植物和组织分离的组织特异性启动子发现于科学和专利文献中的主要原因之一。\n如本文中所使用，术语“可操作地连接”是指单个核酸片段上核酸序列的偶联，使得一个核酸序列的功能由另一个调节。举例来说，启动子在其能够调节编码序列的表达时与所述编码序列可操作地连接(即，编码序列在启动子的转录控制下)。编码序列可以正义或反义定向可操作地连接于调节序列。在另一实例中，本公开的互补RNA区域可以使5'与目标mRNA可操作地连接(直接或间接)，或使3'与目标mRNA可操作地连接，或在目标mRNA内，或针对目标mRNA来说，第一互补区域是5'并且其补体是3'。\n如本文中所使用，短语“重组型构筑体”、“表达构筑体”、“嵌合构筑体”、“构筑体”以及“重组型DNA构筑体”在本文中可互换地使用。重组型构筑体包含核酸片段(例如在自然界中未发现在一起的调节和编码序列)的人造组合。举例来说，嵌合构筑体可以包含来源于不同来源的调节序列和编码序列，或来源于同一来源的调节序列和编码序列，但其以与在自然界中发现的方式不同的方式排列。这类构筑体可单独使用或可与载体结合使用。如所属领域的技术人员众所周知，如果使用载体，那么载体的选择取决于用于使宿主细胞转型的方法。举例来说，可使用质体载体。所属领域的技术人员深知必须存在于载体上以便成功转型、选择和繁殖包含本公开的经分离的核酸片段中的任一种的宿主细胞的基因元件。所属领域的技术人员还将认识到不同的独立转型事件将引起不同的表达的量和模式(Jones等人,(1985)《欧洲分子生物学杂志(EMBO J.)》4:2411-2418；De Almeida等人,(1989)《分子基因遗传学(Mol.Gen.Genetics)》218:78-86)，并且必须筛检多个事件以便获得显示所需表达量和模式的植株。这类筛检可尤其通过DNA的蛋白质分析、mRNA表达的北方印记分析(Northern analysis)、蛋白质表达的免疫印迹分析或表现型分析来实现。载体可以是质体、病毒、噬菌体、前病毒、噬菌粒、转座子、人工染色体等，其自发复制并且可整合入宿主细胞的染色体。载体还可以是非自发复制的裸RNA聚核苷酸、裸DNA聚核苷酸、由内相同股的DNA和RNA组成的聚核苷酸、聚赖氨酸结合的DNA或RNA、肽结合的DNA或RNA、脂质体结合的DNA等。如本文中所使用，术语“表达”是指功能性最终产物(例如mRNA或蛋白质(前驱体或成熟物))的产生。\n在一些实施例中，细胞或生物体具有至少一种异源特性。如本文中所使用，术语“异源特性”是指由外源性DNA区段、异源聚核苷酸或异源核酸赋予经转型的宿主细胞或转基因生物体的表现型。本公开关注表现型的多种变化，包括(但不限于)修改植物中的脂肪酸组成、改变植物的氨基酸含量、改变植物的病原体防御机制、提高具有经济重要特性的植物的产量(例如谷物产量、草料产量等)等。这些结果可使用本公开的方法和组合物通过提供异源产物的表达或增加的内源性产物的表达来获得。\n“合成组合”可包括本公开的植物和微生物的组合。组合可例如通过用本公开的微生物涂布植物(如农业植物)的种子的表面或宿主植物组织(根、茎干、树叶等)来获得。此外，“合成组合”可包括多种品系或物种的微生物的组合。合成组合具有至少一个可区分所述组合与自然界中存在的任何组合的变量。变量尤其可以是不会天然存在的种子或植物组织上微生物的浓度，不会天然存在的和植物的组合，或不会天然共同存在的微生物或品系的组合。在这些实例中的每一个中，合成组合显示人为迹象并且具有当单独地考虑组合中的个别元素时不存在的结构和/或功能属性。\n在一些实施例中，微生物可以对种子或植物来说是“内源性”。如本文中所使用，如果微生物是来源于作为其来源的植物样品，那么微生物对植物或种子视为“内源性”。也就是说，是否发现微生物在自然界中与所述植物相关联。在其中内源性微生物施用于植物的实施例中，那么内源性微生物以与在自然界中在植物上发现的含量不同的量施用。因此，如果微生物以在自然界中不存在的含量存在于既定植物上，那么对所述植物来说是内源性的微生物仍可与植物形成合成组合。\n在一些实施例中，微生物可以对种子或植物来说是“外源性”(又称为“异源性”)。如本文中所使用，如果微生物不来源于作为其来源的植物样品，那么微生物对植物或种子视为“外源性”。也就是说，是否发现微生物在自然界中不与所述植物相关联。举例来说，通常与玉米植物的叶组织相关联的微生物视为对另一种在自然界中不含所述微生物的玉米植物的叶组织来说是外源性。在另一实例中，通常与玉米植物相关联的微生物视为对在自然界中不含所述微生物的小麦植物来说是外源性。\n微生物还可以“以外源方式安置”在既定植物组织上。这意味着微生物置放于在自然界中未在上面发现其的植物组织上。举例来说，如果既定微生物仅在既定植物的根上天然存在，那么所述微生物可以外源方式施用于植物的地上组织并且将因此“以外源方式安置”在所述植物组织上。同样，当施用于不天然具有微生物或不天然具有所施用的数目的微生物的植物上时，所述微生物视为以外源方式安置。\n本文中的组合物和方法可向宿主植物提供改良的“农艺特性”或“重要的农艺特性”，其可包括(但不限于)以下：与从不具有所述种子处理剂配制物的种子生长的等值植物相比，改变含油量、改变蛋白质含量、改变种子碳水化合物组成、改变种子油组成以及改变种子蛋白质组成、化学耐性、耐寒性、延缓老化、抗病性、耐旱性、耳穗重量、生长改良、健康增强、耐热性、除草剂耐性、食草动物耐性、改良氮固定、改良氮利用、改良根架构、改良水使用效率、增加生物质量、增加根长度、增加的种子重量、增加芽长度、增加的产量、在水有限条件下增加产量、果仁质量、果仁水分含量、金属耐性、耳穗数目、每个耳穗的果仁数目、结荚编号、营养增强、抗病原体性、抗虫性、光合作用能力改良、耐盐性、常绿、活力改良、增加成熟种子的干重、增加成熟种子的鲜重、增加每个植物的成熟种子的数目、增加叶绿素含量、增加每个植物的结荚数目、增加每个植物的结荚长度、降低每个植物的凋谢的叶子的数目、降低每个植物的严重凋谢的叶子的数目以及增加每个植物的未凋谢的叶子的数目、代谢物含量的可检测的调节、转录物含量的可检测的调节以及蛋白质组的可检测的调节。\n由本公开的微生物和聚生体赋予既定植物物种有益特性的能力\n本公开利用微生物赋予所需植物物种(如相关农艺物种)有益性质(或有益特性)。在本公开中，术语“有益性质”或“有益特性”可以互换地使用并且表示通过施用如本文中所描述的微生物或微生物聚生体来调节相关的所需植物表现型或基因性质。如前所述，在一些方面中，可能极佳的是由既定微生物产生的代谢物最终负责调节或赋予既定植物有益特性。\n存在许多可通过施用本公开的微生物来调节的有益特性。举例来说，微生物可具有赋予植物物种一种或多种有益性质的能力，例如：增加生长、提高产量、提高氮利用效率、提高耐胁迫性、提高耐旱性、提高光合率、增强水使用效率、提高抗病原体性、未必影响植物产量，但实际上解决植物功能性，引起植物提高相关代谢物的产生的对植物架构的修改等。\n在一些方面中，本文中教示的微生物提供广泛范围的农业应用，包括：改良谷物、果实和花朵产量；改良植物部分的生长；改良抗病性；改良在极端气候中的存活率；以及改良其它所需植物表现型特征。\n在一些方面中，可向植物施用本公开的经分离的微生物、聚生体和/或农业组合物，以调节或改变植物特征，如改变含油量、改变蛋白质含量、改变种子碳水化合物组成、改变种子油组成、改变种子蛋白质组成、化学耐性、耐寒性、延缓老化、抗病性、耐旱性、耳穗重量、生长改良、健康增强、耐热性、除草剂耐性、食草动物耐性、改良的固氮作用、改良的氮利用、改良的根架构、改良的水使用效率、增加生物质量、增加根长度、增加种子重量、增加芽长度、增加产量、在水受限条件下增加产量、果仁质量、果仁水分含量、金属耐性、耳穗数目、每个耳穗的果仁数目、结荚数目、营养增强、抗病原体性、抗虫性、光合作用能力改良、耐盐性、常绿、活力改良、增加成熟种子的干重、增加成熟种子的鲜重、增加每个植物的成熟种子的数目、增加叶绿素含量、增加每个植物的结荚数目、增加每个植物的结荚长度、降低每个植物的凋谢的叶子的数目、降低每个植物的严重凋谢的叶子的数目以及增加每个植物的未凋谢的叶子的数目、代谢物含量的可检测的调节、转录物含量的可检测的调节以及与参考植物有关的蛋白质组的可检测的调节。\n在一些方面中，可向植物施用本公开的经分离的微生物、聚生体和/或农业组合物，以按负性方式调节具体植物特征。举例来说，在一些方面中，本公开的微生物能够降低相关表现型特性，如可能在一些应用中需要这种功能性。举例来说，本公开的微生物可具有降低根生长或降低根长度的能力。或微生物可具有降低发芽生长或降低植物成长速度的能力，如在某些应用中需要植物特性的这些调节。\n经分离的微生物-表1-3\n在各方面中，本公开提供经分离的微生物，包括所鉴别的微生物物种的新品系，其呈现于表1-3中。\n在其它方面中，本公开提供表1-3中鉴别的物种和品系的经分离的完整微生物培养物。这些培养物可包含多种浓度的微生物。\n在各方面中，本公开提供在农业中利用选自表1-3的微生物。\n在一些实施例中，本公开提供属于以下属的经分离的微生物物种：固氮菌属(Azotobacter)、固氮螺旋菌属(Azospirillum)、芽孢杆菌属(Bacillus)、芽生杆菌属(Bosea)、柄杆菌属(Caulobacter)、杜擀氏菌属(Duganella)、黄杆菌属(Flavobacterium)、草螺菌属(Herbaspirillum)、橙黄杆菌属(Luteibacter)、马赛菌属(Massilia)、粘液杆菌属(Mucilaginibacter)、泛菌属(Pantoeo)、类芽孢杆菌属(Paenibacillus)、极单胞菌属(Polaromonas)、杜擀氏菌属(Pseudoduganella)、假单胞菌属(Pseudomonas)、拉恩氏菌属(Rahnella)、拉力菌属(Ramlibacter)、根瘤菌属(Rhizobium)、赤球菌屬(Rhodococcus)、红育菌属(Rhodoferax)、鞘氨醇杆菌属(Sphingobium)以及寡养单胞菌属(Stenotrophomonas)。\n在一些实施例中，在农业中利用来自芽生杆菌属的微生物以赋予植物物种一种或多种有益特性。\n在一些实施例中，本公开提供经分离的微生物物种，其选自以下组成的组：褐球固氮菌、成团泛菌(最近重新分配成瓦氏泛菌)、荧光假单胞菌、稻皮假单胞菌、恶臭假单胞菌、水生拉恩菌、埃特里根瘤菌、红串赤球菌以及嗜麦芽窄食单胞菌。\n在一些实施例中，本公开提供物种的新型经分离的微生物，其选自以下组成的组：褐球固氮菌、成团泛菌(最近重新分配成瓦氏泛菌)、荧光假单胞菌、稻皮假单胞菌、恶臭假单胞菌、水生拉恩菌、埃特里根瘤菌、红串赤球菌以及嗜麦芽窄食单胞菌。这些前述物种的具体新品系可见于表1-3中。\n此外，本公开涉及具有与表1-3中鉴别的微生物的特征基本上类似的特征的微生物。\n本公开中鉴别的经分离的微生物物种和所述物种的新品系能够赋予目标植物物种有益性质或特性。\n举例来说，表1-3中描述的经分离的微生物或所述微生物的聚生体能够改良植物健康和活力。可定量测量改良的植物健康和活力，例如通过测量所述微生物应用对植物表现型或基因型特性的作用。\n微生物聚生体-表1-3\n在各方面中，本公开提供微生物聚生体，其包含选自表1中鉴别的微生物的至少任何两种微生物的组合。\n在其它方面中，本公开提供微生物聚生体，其包含选自表2中鉴别的微生物的至少任何两种微生物的组合。\n在其他方面中，本公开提供微生物聚生体，其包含选自表3中鉴别的微生物的至少任何两种微生物的组合。\n并且，本公开提供微生物聚生体，其包含选自表1-3中鉴别的微生物的至少任何两种微生物的组合。\n在某些实施例中，本公开的聚生体包含两种微生物，或三种微生物，或四种微生物，或五种微生物，或六种微生物，或七种微生物，或八种微生物，或九种微生物，或十种或更多种微生物。聚生体中的所述微生物是不同微生物物种，或微生物物种的不同品系。\n在一些实施例中，本公开提供聚生体，其包含：至少两种属于以下属的经分离的微生物物种：固氮菌属、固氮螺旋菌属、芽孢杆菌属、芽生杆菌属、柄杆菌属、杜擀氏菌属、黄杆菌属、草螺菌属、橙黄杆菌属、马赛菌属、粘液杆菌属、泛菌属、类芽孢杆菌属、极单胞菌、杜擀氏菌属、假单胞菌属、拉恩氏菌属、拉力菌属、根瘤菌属、赤球菌屬、红育菌属、鞘氨醇杆菌属以及寡养单胞菌属。\n在一些实施例中，本公开提供聚生体，其包含：至少两种选自以下组成的组的经分离的微生物物种：褐球固氮菌、成团泛菌(最近重新分配成瓦氏泛菌)、荧光假单胞菌、稻皮假单胞菌、恶臭假单胞菌、水生拉恩菌、埃特里根瘤菌、红串赤球菌以及嗜麦芽窄食单胞菌。\n在一些实施例中，本公开提供聚生体，其包含：物种的至少两种新型经分离的微生物品系，其选自以下组成的组：褐球固氮菌、成团泛菌(最近重新分配成瓦氏泛菌)、荧光假单胞菌、稻皮假单胞菌、恶臭假单胞菌、水生拉恩菌、埃特里根瘤菌、红串赤球菌以及嗜麦芽窄食单胞菌。这些前述物种的具体新品系可见于表1-3中。\n在具体方面中，本公开提供微生物聚生体，其包含如表4-10中分组的物种。关于表4-10，字母A到I表示本公开的微生物的非限制性选择，其定义为：\nA＝表1中鉴别的褐球固氮菌和相关新品系；\nB＝表1中鉴别的成团泛菌(最近重新分配成瓦氏泛菌)和相关新品系；\nC＝表1中鉴别的荧光假单胞菌和相关新品系；\nD＝表1中鉴别的稻皮假单胞菌和相关新品系；\nE＝表1中鉴别的恶臭假单胞菌和相关新品系；\nF＝表1中鉴别的水生拉恩菌和相关新品系；\nG＝表1中鉴别的埃特里根瘤菌和相关新品系；\nH＝表1中鉴别的红串赤球菌和相关新品系；以及\nI＝表1中鉴别的嗜麦芽窄食单胞菌和相关新品系。\n表4：

for General andMolecular Microbiology)》,美国微生物学会(American Society for Microbiology),Washington,D.C.(1994)和Lennette,E.H.(编),《临床微生物学手册(Manual of ClinicalMicrobiology)》,第三版,美国微生物学会,Washington,D.C.(1980)，其皆以引用的方式并入本文中。\n分离可通过将样品以条纹形式置放于固体培养基(例如营养物琼脂板)上以获得单个群落(其特征在于上文描述的表现型特性(例如革兰氏阳性/阴性(Gram positive/negative)、能够以好氧/厌氧方式形成孢子、细胞形态、碳源代谢、酸/碱产生、酶分泌、代谢分泌物等)和降低用变得被污染的培养物进行操作的可能性来实现。\n举例来说，对于本公开的经分离的细菌，生物学上纯的分离物可通过生物样品的重复继代培养获得，在每次继代培养之后以条纹方式置放于固体培养基上以获得个别群落。制备冻干细菌、使其解冻和生长的方法是众所周知的，例如Gherna,R.L.和C.A.Reddy.2007,《培养物保藏(Culture Preservation)》,第1019-1033页,C.A.Reddy,T.J.Beveridge,J.A.Breznak,G.A.Marzluf,T.M.Schmidt和L.R.Snyder编,美国微生物学协会,Washington,D.C.,1033页；其以引用的方式并入本文中。因此，涵盖在含有甘油的溶液中，在-70℃下冷冻长期储存的经干燥的液体配制物和培养物以用于提供本发明的配制物。\n本公开的细菌可在好氧条件下，在液体培养基中繁殖。用于使本公开的细菌菌株生长的培养基包括碳源、氮源和无机盐，以及特殊需要的物质，如维生素、氨基酸、核酸等。可用于使细菌菌株生长的适合的碳源的实例包括(但不限于)淀粉、蛋白胨、酵母提取物、氨基酸、糖，如葡萄糖、阿拉伯糖、甘露糖、葡糖胺、麦芽糖等；有机酸(如乙酸、反丁烯二酸、己二酸、丙酸、柠檬酸、葡糖酸、苹果酸、丙酮酸、丙二酸等)的盐；醇，如乙醇和甘油等；油或脂肪，如大豆油、米糠油、橄榄油、玉米油、芝麻油。所添加的碳源的量根据碳源种类而变化并且通常在每升培养基1到100克之间。优选的是，培养基中含有0.1-5％(W/V)的浓度的葡萄糖、淀粉和/或蛋白胨作为主要碳源。可用于使本发明的细菌菌株生长的适合的氮源的实例包括(但不限于)氨基酸、酵母提取物、胰蛋白胨、牛肉提取物、蛋白胨、硝酸钾、硝酸铵、氯化铵、硫酸铵、磷酸铵、氨或其组合。氮源的量根据氮源的类型而变化，通常在每升培养基0.1到30克之间。无机盐、磷酸二氢钾、磷酸氢二钾、磷酸氢二钠、硫酸镁、氯化镁、硫酸铁、硫酸亚铁、氯化铁、氯化亚铁、硫酸锰、氯化锰、硫酸锌、氯化锌、硫酸铜、氯化钙、氯化钠、碳酸钙、碳酸钠可单独或以组合形式使用。无机酸的量根据无机盐的种类而变化，通常在每升培养基0.001到10克之间。特殊需要的物质的实例包括(但不限于)维生素、核酸、酵母提取物、蛋白胨、肉类提取物、麦芽提取物、干燥酵母和其组合。培养可在实现细菌菌株生长的温度下实现，基本上在20℃与46℃之间。在一些方面中，温度范围是30℃-37℃。对于最佳生长，在一些实施例中，可将培养基调节到pH 7.0-7.4。应了解，还可以使用市售培养基培养细菌菌株，如可从密歇根州底特律(Detroit,MI)的Difco购得的Nutrient Broth或NutrientAgar。应了解，培养时间可视所使用的培养基类型和作为主要碳源的糖的浓度而不同。\n在各方面中，培养持续24-96小时。使用所属领域中是众所周知的方法分离由此获得的细菌细胞。实例包括(但不限于)薄膜过滤和离心分离离心分离。可使用氢氧化钠等调节pH值并且可使用冷冻干燥器干燥培养物，直到水含量变成4％或更低。微生物共培养物可通过如上文所描述繁殖各品系来获得。应了解，当可使用相容的培养条件时，可共同培养微生物品系。\n经分离的微生物-微生物品系\n微生物可基于多相分类而区分入一个属，所述多相分类将所有可获得的表现型和基因型资料合并成共同分类(Vandamme等人,1996,《多相分类，细菌分类学的共同方法(Polyphasic taxonomy,a consensus approach to bacterial systematics)》,《微生物学综述(Microbiol Rev)》1996,60:407-438)。一种公认的用于定义物种的基因型方法是基于整体基因组相关性，使得在标准条件下，在5℃或更低的ΔTm(同源与异源杂交物之间的熔融温度的差异)下使用DNA-DNA杂交时共有约70％或更高相关性的品系被视为相同物种的成员。因此，共有超过前述70％临界值的群组可被视为相同物种的变异体。\n通常施用16S rRNA序列产生物种之间的区别，其中16S rRNA序列与参考序列共有小于指定序列一致性％，那么用于获得序列的两种生物体视为不同物种。\n因此，如果遍及16S rRNA序列共有至少80％、85％、90％、95％、97％、98％或99％序列一致性，那么可将微生物视为相同物种。在各方面中，微生物仅在其共有至少95％一致性时才可被视为相同物种。\n此外，可定义物种的微生物品系，如遍及16S rRNA序列共有至少80％、85％、90％、95％、97％、98％或99％序列一致性的品系。还可以针对参考序列与23S rRNA序列进行比较。在各方面中，微生物仅在其共有至少95％一致性时才可被视为相同品系。在实施例中，“大体上类似的基因特征”意指共有至少95％一致性的微生物。\n在不存在表现型测定的情况下，无法培养的微生物通常无法指定为确切物种，微生物可被指定成一个属内的丝状菌名称，只要其16S rRNA序列与已知的物种符合一致性原理即可。\n一种方法是观察序列空间中紧密相关物种的许多品系的分布和鉴别从其它丛集良好解析的品系的丛集。这种方法已通过使用多核(管家(house-keeping))基因的级联序列评估丛集模式来发展，并且已被称为多位点序列分析(MLSA)或多位点序列系统发生分析。已通过现有分类方法将MLSA成功地用于探索指定为极紧密相关物种的许多品系中的丛集模式，以观察一个属内或更广泛分类组内少数品系之间的关系，和解决特定分类问题。更一般来说，所述方法可用于探寻细菌物种是否存在，也就是说，观察一大群类似品系是否总是属于良好解析的丛集，或在一些情况下，是否存在其中未观察到明显分离成各丛集的基因连续性。\n为了更准确进行各属的测定，进行表现型特性(如形态)、生物化学以及生理学特征的测定以用于与参考属原型进行比较。群落形态可包括颜色、形状、色素沉着、粘液产生等。关于形状、尺寸、革兰氏反应(Gram reaction)、细胞外物质、孢子内壁的存在、鞭毛存在和位置、活动性和包涵体来描述细胞的特征。生物化学和生理学特征描述生物体在不同范围的温度、pH值、盐度和大气压条件的生长，在不同的唯一碳和氮源存在下的生长。所属领域的一般技术人员将合理地知晓定义本公开的各属的表现型特性。举例来说，使用具体琼脂(例如YMA)上的群落颜色、形式以及纹理来鉴别根瘤菌属的物种。\n在一个实施例中，本文中教示的微生物是利用16S

and Antagonistic Responses of Herbicide Combinations)》,1967Weeds,第15卷,第20-22页，其以全文引用的方式并入本文中。因此，“协同”意指在其存在时可使所需作用增加超过累加量的分量。\n本公开的经分离的微生物和聚生体可以协同方式提高农业活性化合物以及农业助剂化合物的效果。\n在其它实施例中，当根据所教示的方法鉴别的微生物或微生物聚生体与肥料组合时，可发现协同作用。\n此外，在某些实施例中，本公开利用协同相互作用以定义微生物聚生体。也就是说，在某些方面中本公开将某些发挥协同作用的微生物物种共同组合成聚生体，其赋予植物有益特性，或其与增加有益的植物特性相关。\n根据本发明研发的农业组合物可与某些助剂一起配制，以改良已知的活性农业化合物的活性。这具有可降低配制物中活性成分的量，同时保持活性化合物的功效的优点，因此使成本保持尽可能低并且符合任何官方法规。在个别情况下，也有可能拓宽活性化合物的作用范围，因为植物(在未添加情况下用具体活性成分进行的处理不足够成功)可实际上通过添加某些助剂以及所公开的微生物分离物和聚生体来成功地处理。此外，当环境条件不利时，在个别情况下可通过适合的配制物增加活性的性能。\n可用于农业组合物中的这类助剂可以是佐剂。通常，佐剂呈表面活性或盐类化合物形式。视其作用模式而定，其可大致分类为调节剂、活化剂、肥料、pH值缓冲剂等。调节剂影响配制物的湿润、粘着以及扩散特性。活化剂破坏植物的蜡质表层并且改良活性成分对质表层的渗透(短期(数分钟)和长期(数小时))。肥料(如硫酸铵、硝酸铵或尿素)可改良活性成分的吸收和可溶性并且可降低活性成分的拮抗性。pH值缓冲剂常规地用于使配制物具有最佳pH值。\n关于本公开的农业组合物的其它实施例，参见《农业化学配制物的化学方法和技术(Chemistry

G和Daisy B(2003)《微生物学和分子生物学综述(Microbiology and MolecularBiology Reviews)》67(4):491-502；Zinniel DK等人(2002),《应用和环境微生物学(Applied and Environmental Microbiology)》68(5):2198-2208)。\n在本公开的一个实施例中，从根组织分离微生物。用于从植物材料分离微生物的另一种方法详细描述于下文中。\n在一个实施例中，使微生物群体暴露于(在方法之前或在方法中的任何阶段)选择压力。举例来说，使微生物在其添加到植物生长培养基(优选是无菌的)之前暴露于巴氏灭菌可能增强选择用于所需特性的植物将与可在不良条件下、在市售储存期中或在不良环境中以涂层形式施用于种子的更易于存活的孢子形成微生物相关联的机率。\n在某些实施例中，如上文中所提及，微生物可以粗物质形式使用并且无需从植物或培养基分离。举例来说，可获得包括经鉴别对所选择的植物有益的微生物的植物材料或生长培养基并且用作粗微生物来源以用于下一轮方法，或在方法结束时用作粗微生物来源。举例来说，可获得完整的植物材料并且任选地处理，如覆盖或挤压。或者，可从植物分离所选择的植物的个别组织或部分(如叶子、茎干、根和种子)并且任选地处理，如覆盖或挤压。在某些实施例中，可从一种或多种所选择的植物移出与一种或多种微生物的第二集合相关联的植物的一个或多个部分，并且其中进行方法的任何连续重复，接枝到植物育种方法的任何步骤中使用的一种或多种植物上。\n能够从施用所公开的微生物、聚生体以及包含其的组合物获益的植物\n本公开的方法中可使用许多各种不同植物，包括藓类植物和地衣类植物和藻类植物。在实施例中，植物具有经济、社会或环境价值。举例来说，植物可包括用作粮食作物、纤维作物、油作物、用于林业、用于纸浆与造纸工业、用作生物燃料制剂的原料和用作观赏植物的植物。\n在其它实施例中，植物可能在经济、社会或环保上不合乎需要，如野草。以下是本公开的方法可适用的植物类型的非限制性实例的列表：\n粮食作物：\n谷类，例如玉米、大米、小麦、大麦、高粱、小米、燕麦、黑麦、黑小麦以及荞麦；\n叶菜，例如十字花科植物，如甘蓝、椰菜、小白菜、火箭；沙拉绿叶菜，如菠菜、水芹以及莴苣；\n果实和开花蔬菜，例如鳄梨、甜玉米、洋蓟；瓜类，例如笋瓜、黄瓜、甜瓜、小胡瓜、南瓜；茄属蔬菜/果实，例如蕃茄、茄子以及辣椒；\n荚果蔬菜，例如落花生、花生、豌豆、大豆、菜豆、小扁豆、鸡豆、秋葵；\n球茎和茎菜类蔬菜，例如芦笋、芹菜、葱属作物(Allium

\n实例1：在美国试验中评估暴露于微生物聚生体的植物的表现型\n表14中公开的植物在167ml根体积下在受控环境中，并且通常在土壤基质中生长。对于所有物种，所有实验的腔室光周期设定成16小时。由于植物高度在实验期间增加，光强度范围是180μmol PAR m-2s-1到约mol PAR m-2s-1。\n对于玉蜀黍、大豆和双色高粱实验，空气温度在光周期期间通常是28℃，在夜间降低到23℃。对于小麦实验，空气温度在光周期期间通常是24℃，在夜间降低到20℃。\n在早期无性繁殖生长期间，通常在V3发育期之前测量表现型。\n使用可提供叶绿素含量指数的计量器，非相消地沿最嫩的完全扩增树叶在中间位置测量叶绿素含量(CCM-200，Opti Sciences，美国新罕布什尔州赫德森(Hudson,NH,US))。\n在植物在设定成80℃的干燥箱中干燥到恒重之后测量完整植物、芽和根干重。对于在每次实验中测量的每个表现型，测量至少10个重复植物。\n在各实验中进行未接种的种子的对照处理，以用于与由用微生物聚生体接种的种子生长的植物进行比较。\n表14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n表14中呈现的资料描述与相同实验中对照性操作相比，具体联合体改变相关表现型的时间百分比(功效)。所测量的表现型是完整植物干重(植物)、芽干重(芽)、根干重(根)、叶绿素含量(叶绿素)以及叶子温度(Tleaf)。\n所呈现的资料是针对对照物测试的特定联合体的次数的平均值(评估值)。对于在不同编号的评估中测量不同表现型的聚生体，在资料点旁边置放星号以使表现型与评估编号匹配。已分解和显示特定作物物种(作物)的评估值。\n所呈现的资料鉴别在超过60％的评估值中增加相关表现型(命中率>59)的聚生体，和在超过60％的评估值中降低相关表现型(命中率<41)的聚生体。记录相关表现型中的增加和降低以反映相关选择表现型的降低与产量相关性的可能性。通过降低的叶绿素进行的雨棚光合成改良和通过降低的芽生物质量进行的耐旱性改良组成两个实例。\n实例2：在新西兰试验中评估暴露于微生物聚生体的植物的表现型\n由以在25℃下培育48到72小时的R2A上的传播培养盘形式生长的分离物制备接种体。通过与无菌蒸馏水(SDW)掺合来收集群落，其接着转移到无菌容器中。将所收集的细胞的连续稀释物涂布并且在25℃下培育24小时，以评估各悬浮液中集落形成单位(CFU)的数目。使用个别分离物或分离物的掺合物(聚生体)制备稀释物以传递约1×105cfu/微生物/种子，并且通过在液体悬浮液中渗吸或通过用5％植物胶和油过度处理来接种种子。\n在农业土壤中，在24到48小时处理内种植对应于表15中的植物的种子，灌注培养基或惰性生长培养基。植物在小盆(28mL到200mL)中，在受控环境或温室中生长。对于所有物种，所有实验的腔室光周期设定成16小时。空气温度通常保持在22-24℃之间。\n除非另有说明，否则所有植物用自来水每周浇水2到3次。生长条件根据相关特性变化并且包括如下施用肥料、灌溉制度和盐胁迫的操作：\n●低N-在灌注培养基或惰性生长培养基的土壤中种植种子，其中不施用N肥料\n●中等N-在补充有市售N肥料达到135kg/ha所施用的N的当量的土壤或生长培养基中种植种子\n●不溶解的P-在灌注培养基或惰性生长基质中种植种子并且用含有三磷酸钙作为唯一磷酸盐肥料形式的四分之一强度皮氏液体培养基(Pikovskaya's liquid medium)浇灌。\n●冷胁迫-在土壤、灌注培养基或惰性生长培养基中种植种子并且在10℃下培育一周，随后转移到植物生长室中。\n●盐胁迫-在土壤、灌注培养基或惰性生长培养基中种植种子并且用含有100到200mg/L NaCl的溶液浇灌。\n制备用于各实验的未经处理的(未施用微生物)对照物。在整个生长环境中，在塔盘上随机分配植物。对于各实验中的每次处理，制备10到30个重复植物。在早期无性繁殖生长期间，通常在V3发育期之前并且在播种之后的3到6周测量表现型。修剪叶子并且称重。洗涤根，以印迹方式干燥并且称重。结果表明针对未经处理的对照物的处理的性能。\n表15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n表15中呈现的资料描述与相同实验中的对照性操作相比，微生物物种或品系改变相关表现型的效率。对于植物生长，所测量的表现型是在不存在或存在胁迫情况下的芽鲜重和根鲜重(分析法)。对于各微生物物种，整体效率评分表明在独立评估中所述物种的品系使芽和根鲜重增加的时间百分比。对于各物种，提供各独立分析法的特殊性，提供品系ID(品系)和进行分析法的作物物种(作物)。对于各独立分析法，提供与对照物相比的芽和根鲜重的增加百分比。\n实例3：在美国田间试验评估暴露于微生物聚生体的玉米的产量影响\n表16中呈现的资料概述在美国中西部的八个地区测试的六种聚生体与对照物相比的最终产量变化。还呈现来自在美国加利福尼亚进行的两个干旱试验的最终产量资料。资料表示成试验百分比，其中观察具体量值的每英亩的产量影响(蒲式耳)。所有田间试验是根据标准农艺操作进行。\n表16\n\n\n\n实例4：在新西兰田间试验评估暴露于微生物聚生体的玉米的产量影响\n表17中呈现的资料概述选择聚生体的新西兰田间试验的结果。所呈现的资料描述其中已相对于对照物测试具体聚生体的试验数，和其中聚生体处理相对于对照处理增加最终产量的试验数。所有田间试验是根据标准农艺操作进行。\n表17\n\n\n\n实例5：由ARS培养物收藏中心(NRRL)保藏的微生物\n在一个实验实施例中，本发明人在本公开的应用中利用以下微生物物种。表18详细描述已由美国农业ARS培养物收藏部门(United
